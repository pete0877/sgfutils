C[There is a famous but possibly apocryphal story of how played

out fuseki was in the early Showa period - from 1926 on. Nozawa

Chikucho 7-dan was seen in earnest study over a go board with

another famous player. His students were anxious to know what

he was doing, and so gingerly approached and asked.



He told them that he had studied almost everything there was

to study about fuseki, but one of the few things left was the

two-space high approach move - the one used by Go - to komoku.

He had a hunch his opponent in the Oteai the next day might play

it, so he was preparing.



The students thought he was mocking them, as however strong their

teacher was, he couldn't predict what his opponent would do.

We are invited to imagine their astonishment the next day when

White played precisely as Nozawa predicted.

C[It was conventional wisdom in ten-game matches that the openings

should be varied in each game. That had happened so far in this

match.



But with a pleasing symmetry in this last game, Go reverts for

the first time to the opening used in Game 1, although in a diferent

order.



White is therefore once again putting all his emphasis on outside

influence and speed. It is noticeable, however, that Black's

strategy is much more oriented to the centre in this game.

C[This should have been at - A - to defend the corner, said Kitani.

As it is, he gets embroiled in negotiations in the lower left

corner over who will get sente to play first in the upper right.

C[A mistake. Go rashly played it after just one minute's thought.

It forces Black to connect at - A -, but that makes the later fighting

easier for Black.

of the marked stone.

C[Go spent 31 minutes on this, although the alternative - >> extending

to 'a' - would be patently slack.

C[White starts a ko that so dominates everything on the board that

the only ko threats that really matter are local ones.



Black has local threats at - A - and - B - that White cannot ignore.

White has none.



But it would be of no benefit to Black to adopt too simplistic

a view and to take the ko. If he does, White obviously connects

at - C - since he has no suitable ko threats. But this makes a

ko that Black has to win. White is safe and risks nothing, yet

Black's group is in danger. He would then have to save it by

connecting the ko, but this leaves him with awful shape. Worse

- in Kitani's mind - White will have sente.



Black therefore has to try to win the ko more efficiently.

;B[fi];W[gj]

C[Necessary. If White connects the ko, Black plays here.

];B[gh];W[oe]

C[This is the best Go can do as a ko threat.

];B[hh]

C[Kitani said he could have continued fighting the ko by using

threats at - A - and - B -, but as he had Black 77 up his sleeve,

he decided to connect at once. This secures close on 30 points

of territory.

C[Certainly powerful, but Black can defend his group.

C[Once the safety of his group in the upper right was established,

Kitani said that he had the thicker game. He meant that, although

territories were not yet defined, his groups were more solid

and likely to turn into territory.



He set to work with Black 101 to prove this.

C[Despite his favourable prospects, Kitani spent 59 minutes on

Black 121, pondering the order of the endgame moves and confirming

he was ahead.

C[Go in turn spent 51 minutes on this, trying to engineer an upset.

C[Black 123 - 37 minutes - caused unnecessary complications, said

Kitani. Cutting at - A - was good enough.

C[Black's marked stone beautifully combines a pincer and an extension.

Although White can run away with the pincered stone, Black has

settled himself ideally with the fixed pattern in the corner,

and now White is the only one with a weak running group.
