C[Black 17 and 19 are trying to give the white group bad shape. Maybe they are too too greedy. Jumping out is more normal.]

;W[el]

C[White 20 is an incisive, fighting move.]

C[Black could play at 'a' to live in the corner, but it is too small.]

C[Prior to 45, Black's big group has become thicker, but he has lost territory on the upper side. It is difficult to judge who has the better result. Black 45 starts another battle.]

LB[ei:a][eg:b][gf:c]C[White 64 protects the cutting point 'a'. If Black 

'a', White can play 'b'. 64 also leaves the possibility of playing 'c' to fight a ko.]

;B[fh]

;W[cq]

;B[cr]

;W[bq]

LB[gp:a]C[White 66 and 68 are not necessary. Escape at 'a' is better.]

C[Up to 81, White has lost too much on territory. The result favours Black.]

;W[gm]

TR[gh];B[nq]

C[Black 83 is better at 'a' to make the group thick.]

LB[gh:a];W[gf]

LB[gh:a]C[Compared with the actual result, Black 85 would have done better coming out at 'a'.]

C[Although Black wins the ko fight, he doesn't get much benefit from it.]

;W[ip]

TR[ip][lp]

C[White's two marked stones destroyed Black's territory on the lower side and all 

the Black stones in the center have become very weak. So it seems that it was a mistake for 

Black to fight the ko.]

C[The aim of 102 is to prevent the Black exchange 'a' for 'b', then the cut at 'c'

in sente.]

TR[lf:a]

C[Since Black didn't separate White, White protected the cut in sente, as marked, then made life at 180. Black has lost any chance to win the game.]
