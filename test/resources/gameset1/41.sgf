C[White 16 is a tesuji. Since White plays at the marked points

are sente against the corner, Black cannot attack White severely.

C[Because of the tesuji at 16, White has settled himself easily.

C[A probe. But it seems there is no obviously good 

move to follow it if White blocks at < A >.

C[If White had blocked at < A >, the game probably 

would continue to  peacefully.  Instead, White chose to fight

back. That is Gu Li's style.

C[79 is very big. If Black omits this, White would play there are

once in sente.

C[White 92 is better at < A > to make life. He would still be ahead

if he played this way.
