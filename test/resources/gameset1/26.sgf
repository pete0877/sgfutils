TR[gm]C[The marked move is seldom played by pros because most consider the result to here as favouring Black.]

;W[qn]

;B[ic]

;W[ke]

;B[ld]

;W[kd]

;B[lc]

C[Black 59 is perhaps too aggressive, starting a fight too early.]

C[After 69, Black hasn't got much from his aggression. He got some points on the  right, but is now weaker on the left.]

;W[qi]

LB[ig:a][in:b]

C[White 70 is questionable. 'a' is the key point on the board at this moment. It not only makes the White group thick, but also threatens to cut at 'b'.]

;B[ig]

C[Very important point. With this move, Black's choice of fighting with the marked stone become effective.]

TR[lc]

;W[di]

;B[ph]

C[The game is getting difficult for White.]

LB[ql:a][ml:b]

C[86 is trying to make the fighting complicated. If White 86 blocks at 'a', Black will play 'b' and come out easily, whilst the White big group above will be  under pressure - obviously no good for White.]

TR[pn][po]LB[ol:a][pk:b][pm:c]

C[Playing the marked exchange, 87-88, first was necessary for Black. If he omitted it, when he cut at 91, White could have played 'a' then 'c' to kill the black group.]

;W[nm]

;B[on]

C[Since the ladder favours Black, White didn't get much from the fighting.]

LB[mm:a][ql:b][rl:c][rm:d][rk:e][qo:f][rn:g][ro:h][sm:i][qq:j]

C[If White 98 is atari at 'a', Black will play 'b' to 'j' to live in the corner. So 98 has to protect the corner.]

;B[ll]

;B[kl]

;W[jk]

;B[ef]

TR[ef]C[When Black gets this big move 103, he is ahead.]

;W[gf]

C[104 is a little bit too deep. But since White is behind, he has to take risks.]

;B[mh]

;W[nh]

;B[jh]

C[Black's fightback is severe.]

;W[gd]

C[White jumps into Black's territory and leaves the huge group for Black to attack. The benefit Black can get from this attack has become the crux of the game.]

;B[he]

;W[ge]

;B[li]

C[Continues to destroy White's eye space.]

;W[jl]

C[112 is White's losing move. If he protects the cut at 'a', the game  will be more complicated.]

LB[mg:a];B[ii]

LB[fh:a][mg:b]

C[113 is good move. There are two good points for Black after this: 'a' and 'b'. Whichever Black gets, his territory will be superior.]
