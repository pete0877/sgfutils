C[Because White's marked stone may be useful if Black continues to play joseki with 

'a' to 'c', Black chose to play lightly in the corner.]

TR[cf]LB[dn:a][dm:b][cq:c];W[po]

;B[np]

LB[pm:a][pl:b]C[When the upper right corner is Black's, 

choosing a pincer attack at 'a' or 'b' is common. Black 15 looks like a 

passive move. but there is a very aggressive plan behind it.]

;W[qq]

;B[qr]

;W[qk]

LB[qp:a][pl:b]C[If White plays 'a', Black would play 'b'. This 

is Black's trap. But White has seen through it and he played 18 directly.]

;B[qm]

C[19 is an aggressive move. Playing at 'a' is usual.]

LB[rr:a]C[If 26 is hane at 'a', Black would play at 26 and White would be killed.]

;B[rn]

;W[rr]

;B[pl]

C[For Black 29, playing 'a' to 'g', 29, then 'h' to 'n' would probably be better than the game.

In this the sequence, if White 'i' is at '29', 

Black could play 'l', White 'm', Black 'n'. In this position, whether Black can get the

chance to play 'n' is the key issue.]

C[Since Black lives in gote, White got the chance to play the important extension of 50. The result is good for White.]

;W[dr]

C[White 56 sagari is a good move - very calm. Black cannot kill the whole White centre group. The cut at 'a' to capture the four white stones is not big enough. So Black chose to tenuki from the central area.]

C[Black 65, pulling back the weak stone, is not a normal technique. Because Black is behind, 

he wants to make the game complicated.]

;W[oi]

;B[mk]

C[If Black 69 extends at 'a', White could play at 

69, Black 'b' to 'i', and the result is still good for White.]

C[84 is a strong move.]

;B[lh]

C[If Black plays 'a', White 'b' to 'd' could link up with the big group. 87 probably is the only 

choice. ]

LB[hd:a][ic:b][id:c][jc:d];W[he]

;B[mc]

C[Playing 'a' directly would be better.]

LB[kf:a];W[nd]

C[If Black plays 'a', White now could play 1 to 9 to live easily.]

C[Black has connected to the corner in gote, and so White 96 strengthens his group. Black's attack ends up a failure. White is winning.]

;B[fo]

C[If 97 is at 'a' to capture the White centre stones safely, his territory will be too small. 97 wants to expand the moyo.]
