;B[od];W[rc];B[rd]C[too small  O16 is

bigger];W[nd];B[ne];W[jp];B[cf];W[ch];B[cc];W[dc]C[wrong direction, the

top has a black stone sitting right inside your thickness at L16.  In

fact, you can't usually play in this direction unless you have a stone

around K16.];B[cd];W[de];B[db]C[black must play B14 and white has a terrible

position, this not only lets white switch the direction of his wall from

facing the worthless top to the powerfull bottom where his D4 and K4

stones will work wonderfully, but black must crawl along the second line

twice];W[ce];B[eb]C[painful];W[bd];B[bc]

(;W[be];B[fd];W[fe];B[gd];W[ge];B[hd];W[he];B[kj];W[le]C[strange move,

cutting two strong groups.  Simply J10 and it seems white has a large

advantage.];B[oc]C[this is known as aji keshi.  black can play this move

any time and there are other ways to threaten this cut like N18 so it is

best left unplayed.];W[ob];B[nb]C[black is simply giving away territory now]

;W[mb];B[md];W[mc];B[mg]C[loose move.  N15 is more consistant locally,

but probably it is time to tenuki.

M4, C6, O4 all look big];W[ld]C[same comment, if black playes here, he

will have to accept gote twice, and there are very few points to be

gained.

J10 is huge for white, O3 is very big too];B[ko]C[this type of move is usually only good when white is on the

third line.  trading fourth line territory for third line thickness here

will quickly lose the game for black.];W[jo];B[kn];W[jn]C[L4 is bigger,

and blak will probably respond around m4 giving a whole lot of territory

to white and taking a lot from black.  This move is also very big, but

white moyo is very open because of the distance from D4 to C12 and the

L10 stone];B[lq]C[suddenly its a close game again];W[oe]C[strange, this

cut wont work by itself, so it is better not to play it and save it for

later];B[of];W[nf];B[ng];W[mf];B[pe];W[me]C[very bad gote for white, maybe

black is leading now];B[km]C[huge];W[kg]C[this move is bad because if

black responds his territory is even more secure and white hasn't gained

much, or he might ignore and white cant get too far in.];B[hj]

C[a vague

slow move, white can't seal black in here, so black should just play C6

or C7];W[ij]C[I cant understand this];B[fj]C[same comment];W[dj]

C[good move by white, taking territory and attacking.  Now blacks

two stones seem worthless and heavy.  Almost like passing.]

;B[cn]C[good,

but it will be much harder now with white's D10];W[dl]C[99% of the time

you should not pincer twice from the same side.  C5 making black heavy

and then f4 making territoy and attacking seem better.  Black will live

in gote, but white will have a lot of territory and when white invades

black he will have more territory and win];B[fq]C[pros say you can never

counterpincer the D8 pincer (thats why they sometimes play it instead of

C8) but this move looks interesting.];W[eq]C[white should D6 on

principle];B[cp];W[cq];B[do];W[eo];B[bp];W[cm];B[dm];W[em];B[bm]

(;B[co];W[bq]C[B8 is bigger];B[bl];W[jk]C[Black is not quite alive so

B10 is a big probably double sente move, although this is also

huge];B[kk];W[jl];B[ck]C[just B10 is better];W[dk]C[no need for white to

connect, B10 will be sente];B[ii];W[ji];B[ih]C[desperation?]

;W[jh];B[ik];W[jj];B[gg];W[gh]C[seems to me G11 is vital point, but

black should die

regardless];B[fh];W[hg];B[hh];W[gi];B[ig];W[hf];B[fg];W[if]

with H6,G6,G5,F6J4];W[ip];B[lr];W[ks]C[wastes a small ko threat, makes

an invasion a little harder.  Not terrible but no reason for white to

play here];B[ls];W[is]C[too small];B[js]C[way too small.  R5 is worth maybe 30 or 40

points right now.  Also B11 and K18 much bigger];W[kr]C[guess white is running out of time]

really has to try an invasion (maybe R10) or white has absolutely no

hope.  I am 2k* and I would try an invasion :)  there is nothing to
