C[Black 21 is to ensure that his following move, 23, will be sente.

C[The invasion at 30 is severe. Now it is difficult for Black to

make a choice. If he chooses fighting, the result might not be

favourable as White is very thick. If he chooses to sacrifice

the stone, it would be too big.

];B[qi]

C[Black 31 seems a bit unreasonable.

C[After 48,  Black has lost the corner - very big.

C[For Black 49, enclosing White at < A > is more normal.

C[It is interesting that White's marked stone has become a ladder

breaker.

C[White cannot block at < A >, or else Black will play 

<B > to < D >.

C[White 60 is a good move. If Black captures the 

stone at < A >, White will play < B >. White will 

build a thick wall if play goes this way. That's no 

good for Black.

C[Black chooses to fight back.

C[72 is severe.

C[Black has lost too much territory.

];B[im];W[hn];B[go];W[iq]

;B[nh]

C[Since Black is behind on territory, he now attacks the  big white

group.

];W[oh];B[mk];W[gn];B[fn];W[in];B[jl];W[hl]

C[If White allows himself to be enclosed here, Black will build

a huge moyo.

determine the result.
