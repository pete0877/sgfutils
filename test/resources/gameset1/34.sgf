C[White A to C is normal. It is a joseki, then Black has two choices: E and F. By playing 14 

in the lower right corner instead, he may be wanting to settle the positions on the other parts of the 

board before deciding what to play in the upper left.]

C[In this position, if White continues to play the joseki at A, the marked black stone 

will be very well placed. So, white plays the extension directly in the game.]

C[63 was not the best sequence. He should have exchanged A for B first.]


(;W[bi]LB[ch:A]TR[di]

C[64 is a good choice. He cannot achieve much if he plays as in the variation, even though this seems like a severe attack 

on black's marked stone.]

TR[qd][qe][re][rf]

C[Since Black 103 is bigger than capture of the stone at C - or else White will play  A - it 

is not necessary for Black to play the marked moves before 103. If White gets a chance to 

capture at B, the marked Black moves have lost points.]

;W[fk]LB[gi:D][ej:C][fj:B][ek:A]

C[112 is something of a wishful move. He expects Black to play A, then he can play B to D to 

build up the centre.]


;B[dk]LB[dh:F][eh:D][fh:G][ei:C][dj:B][ej:A][fj:E][bk:H]TR[bg][ch][bi]

C[Good move. If White plays A to separate Black, Black can play B to H. The three marked 

white stones will be captured.]


;W[ca]

C[This is a bit early. It loses the possibility of playing A in sente.]

C[White should have played A, which can protect the weakness in sente.]

C[138 is small. It should have been at A.]


;B[mg]LB[oe:B][hf:A][pj:C]

C[139 is a mistake. It should have been A to reduce white's territory. White cannot kill the 

black group, because Black can live with C or connect to the upper side with B.]
