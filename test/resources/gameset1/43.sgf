C[Black 9 is seeking complications. Black is not satisfied with the exchange of 'a' for 'b' which gives White good shape.]

LB[eo:a][fp:b]

;W[iq]

;B[hp]

LB[gp:a]C[11 seems a bit heavy. A jump to 'a' would be better.]

;W[hq]

;B[gp]

C[13 - heavy again. it should be at 'a'.]

LB[eo:a]

;W[do]

C[Fighting back at 14 is the only choice.]

;B[dp]

C[Black 15, making life in the corner, and the extention of 11 and 13 seem to contradict each other.

'a' is the  follow-up to 11 and 13.



But Black probably cannot find a severe way to attack the three White stones if White blocks at 'b'.]

C[The result is good for White.]

;B[cf]

C[Black 21 at 'a' is a big move. It relates to both  territory and thickness.]

C[Black 31 is a little bit too aggressive. But because of the loss on lower side, Black probably has to do this to compete on territory.]

C[White 46 usually is ajikeshi. But, in this situation, it is necessary because it prevents a Black cut at 'a'.]

LB[qj:a]C[48 at 'a' is more urgent.]

LB[mj:a][li:b][pk:c][lj:d][ki:e][ke:f]

C[White 56 at 'a' is more efficient. Then Black 'b', White 56, Black 'c', White 'd', Black 'e', White 'f'. White could keep his lead this way.]

;B[pk]

;W[mj]

;B[ki]

LB[ng:a][mf:b][kd:c][kf:d][jd:e][lj:f][ml:g]C[White 60 at 'a' to 'g' would be better. Since White is then ahead on territory, he only needs to make the group on the right side live to win the game.]

;W[lj]

;B[ke]

C[Good move.]

LB[jk:a][mb:b][lg:c][em:d]C[In discussion after the game, both 

players agreed that  White should play 'a'. Then if Black 70, White 'b', Black 'c' - to prevent being 

separated - White 'd'. This result is better than the game for White. ]

C[88 is a serious mistake. This move should be at 'a' to give up the two white centre

stones and capture the three black stones on the bottom side.]

LB[hl:a];B[hm]

;W[gk]

C[White 90 is the losing move. It did not  pay enough attention to Black coming out with 'a'. 

White 90 must play 'b' to strengthen the centre.]

LB[km:a][oo:b];B[km]

C[Good move. White cannot capture these two Black stones. White's centre group has 

been split. He is in a difficult position.]
