(;W[qg]C[[wund\] This is your first bad move. See variations];B[pi];W[rg]
;B[pg]
(;W[qf]C[[wund\] This is too cautious (slack, weak, slow). See  the variation]

C[[wund\] A good move. But since u played some very  slow moves in your upper right u r slightly behind  now.]
;B[dr];W[cn]C[[wund\] Very good!];B[co];W[do]LB[dn:A]C[[wund\] Better play at A.]
;B[eo];W[dn];B[bo];W[kp]C[[wund\] Your stones 42, 44 and 46 r still very weak. I  think u should try to settle them first.]
;B[lp]

Right now you must defend your group on the lower  side (see the last variation).]

(;W[jm]C[[wund\] It is very bad to give away a stone like 58.  See the variation]
;B[ho];W[im];B[hn];W[hm];B[gm];W[hl]LB[gl:A][hk:B]C[[wund\] This is not good for two reasons :-)

1) Bad shape (better to play A, or at least B).
2) You cannot afford to loose the stones 42, 44, 46  (too many points for black)]
;B[gl];W[gn];B[go];W[fn];B[en];W[fo];B[fp]
(;W[gk]LB[fm:A]C[[wund\] You have to fight here by playing at A (see  the variation)]
;B[fl];W[hk];B[ji];W[ii]LB[fc:A][dc:B]C[[wund\] You have to do something drastic, like  invading the upper side at A or B]
;B[jj];W[ij];B[ih];W[ik]C[[wund\] You are being too cautious again :-)]
;B[hh];W[gj];B[fh];W[hi];B[lj]C[[wund\] This is the time to resign; the black territory   around the left corner and lower side is bigger than  everything white has combined; the upper half of  the board is the difference :-)
