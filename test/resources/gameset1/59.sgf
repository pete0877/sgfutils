;W[of]L[qc][pc][qd][pe][rf][og][jq]C[More common is White 'a' followed by  'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' and 'f'. With this joseki White settles his stones with  territory and sente which is important since there is a very large fuseki  move at the bottom near  the letter 'g'.]
;B[nd];W[qd];B[qc];W[pe];B[od];W[ph]L[rd][re]C[I think it is  both simpler and more natural to play 'a'. White would not like Black 'a',  unless he is prepared to play ko with 'b'.]
;B[pi];W[oh];B[oi]L[qi][qg][rd]C[This move leaves a cutting point at 'a'. The  simple move would be to play 'a'. Perhaps 'b' is a strong move since it  attacks the eyeshape of the white group. Black also want to play 'c' early,  since that is both big and ruin the eyebase for the wh
ite group.];W[iq]L[jq][kq][dq][cq][cp]C[A little careful, 'a' is  perhaps better. Now Black can use his strong Shimari (Q3, Q5) and extend to  'b' building territory fast while White is left with an easy invasion at 'c',  'd', 'e' or something similar.]
;B[kq]L[rd]C[Black could also  start an attack on the White group with 'a' which is natural since White  neglected defending it properly to play first on the lower side.]
;W[io];B[de]L[rd][ko][cp][cn]C[A good point but not so urgent. I know  that playing in the corner is considered as of high priority but right now  Black 'a' feels like the most urgent move. Black also later want to play 'b'  which look passive but it work well with the stones at P
11 and Q11, and it leave the big moves of 23 and an invasion at 'c' or  perhaps 'd' as miai (it does not matter if the opponent play one of them  since you can play the other move, thus those move are not urgent at all so  Black can play the strategic moves  'a' first and then 'b' maintaining a good balance on the board.]
;W[fd];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[ch]L[cg][eh][ei][fe]C[This is a no-no move. Black plays like this only  when his stones are very weak. A contact move like this have a high price:  the White lower left will immediately become much stronger. The correct or at  least popular move is to play at 'a' securing
 at least one eye and settling the group without provoking profitable White  moves.
  If Black want something more spectacular perhaps 'b', 'c' or 'd' is more  interesting, but I cannot see any reason for move like that either.]
;W[dh];B[cg]C[If Black had played here (31) first instead of C12, and  White had answered with E12 (not the normal move but not bad either), then  Black would not have pushed into the two white stones with a move at C12  since it just provoke D11 with any gain.
  During analyzis, reversing the order of move in sequence of 4 moves or so,  often make it easy to find a reason to why the first move in the sequence was  a mistake.]
;W[di]L[ei]C[If Black had played C13 first as  usual. White would have played 'a' which is a little weaker than the  formation of the three White stones in the game which are as effective as  they can be.]
;B[cn]L[rd][ko]C[This is perhaps possible but there  is a simpler way to *win* the game. If Black play 'a' and White defend  followed by Black 'b' the entire board is symmetrical.
The black lower right side is as big as the lower left white side. Both  players have weak cramped groups at the upper parts of the right/left sides.  But there is two differences. White has only one stone in the lower left  corner, if White play there to cl
ose the corner Black get sente which would compensate the white komi (but in  this game there was no komi). Then Black stone at K16 and a rather solid big  upper right corner would give him the lead I think.]
;W[dl]L[cl]C[White 'a' is better since now Black can get eyes below 34 if neccessary.  That would also affect the eyebase of the left side white group, in a long  term perspective.]
;B[cq]L[en][fp][bp][bl]C[Perhaps black can  punish White with Black 'a', W 'b', B 'c', W 35, and Black 'd'. That would  give Black a group with a good base for eyes and a move at 'a' that cut  through the White position.

The move in the game let White cut off the Black stone at C6 and shut in  Black in the corner gaining strength in the center and territory to come.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[fq];W[fp];B[gq];W[gp];B[lo]
L[ko][jn][jm][kn]C[There is no reason to be timid. This is a  race against moyos and Black should play 'a' leaving him the option of moves  like 'b' and 'c' in the future. Now White can aim at playing 'd' instead of  'b'. The difference is that if the White moyo could  grow with points at K7 to K10, while Black loses control over the points M5  to M9.]
;W[mm]C[This is probably a good way to play for White. The  proper way to reduce a moyo is play on the line between the two "corners" of  the moyo in this case the black stones at M5 and P11.]
;B[lm]L[ml][ll][pl][jn][km][rd]C[A contact move again. If White play simply  at 'a' there is an increased risk of White playing at 'c' or 'b' (miai). But  I am not sure of the direct consequences of a move like this since it is so  difficult to read it out but I think a move like Bl
ack 'd' or 'e' is better since it leaves White as weak as possible. The  strongest move is perhaps Black 'f' starting a double attack on White if  White defends.]
;W[ll];B[jm]L[km][ln][kn][ml]C[This look  like a typo/clicko. Black cannot give White the freedom to choose between an  atari at 'a' or 'b' or peeping at 'c' or just leave it as a pain in the ***  for Black.
A solid move at 'a' is fundamental when Black is attacking and White is weak.  This is a move you play when you are escaping quickly - sprinkling useless  stones around to get away with a loose string of stones in the center. In  this game the situation is t
he opposite of that. The stones at M7 is the most important stone in this  game right now since it is contact with a (supposed to be) weak enemy group  and support a cut at 'd'.]
;W[km]L[ml][kl][ln]C[An idea sprung to  my mind. If White simply play 'a' first the Black stone look silly and White  has no problems. If Black then defends against White cutting through his  stones they will get overconcentrated.    in the game White uses his aji of two different ataris immediately  *strengthening* Black and leave himself with two cutting points at 'a' and  'b'. Because of Black's mistake White should have no problems - they belong  to Black.]
;B[ln];W[ml];B[kl]C[Suddenly the Black  stones build an efficient shape again. the situation has not stabilized but  the Black stones do not look silly anymore.    If one again reverses the order of moves the exchange of White L7 for Black  M6 is a clear gain for Black since White have lost the possibility of playing  atari at M6.
  The golden rule of atari: in a center fight one should not play ataris just  because they are sente. Often the opponent's answer to the atari is more  valuable than the stone that caused the atari and thus the result is a loss  for the player of the atari.]
;W[kk];B[jl];W[ni]L[pl]C[White 'a' would be a  great success. It destroy some Black territory. It expands Whites weak stones  in the center but the best thing of all: it *attacks* the black stones on the  right side. Black *must* live with these stones. and probably have to  help White with the weak white groups.
  The move in the game just give Black a reason to defend his stones or  counterattack or something.]
;B[qg]C[Good idea. It might be  unreasonable but the spirit of this move is correct.]
;W[ng];B[rd];W[qe];B[pk]L[pl][pm]C[Black 'a' is better. White  can consider playing 'b' later because of this move.]
;W[oj];B[pj]L[qi][pm]C[Bad forcing move White lose the aji of cutting at 'a'  and a move at 'b' is now less effective (but it can still be a problem for  Black).]
;W[nn]C[This move look a little clumsy, but I really do not  know what to do here for sure.]
;B[no]L[pn][oo][pm]C[Bad since  White 'a' now work easily. I think  'b' is the move here because it defend  against 'c' and White '67' as well. But it would leave a lot of bad aji, so  it might be a little unreasonable.]
;W[on];B[pn]C[Black is  lucky.];W[pm];B[qm];W[pl];B[ql];W[mo];B[mn]L[mp]
[oo][np][op][oq][nq][pp][qp][qo][qn][qq][rp][pr]
[nm]C[This is dangerous. Black is thin and must give way with 'a'.
White can now easily break through Black with the sequence White 'b', Bc, Wd,  Be, Wf, Ba, Wg, Bh, Wi, Bj, Wk, Bl and finally White captures two stones in a  ladder with White 'f'.
  If someone who read this think something like "How could I read 14 move  like that?" the answer is that you *can* do it. It is easy. This sequence has  no interesting variations; it is a straight road with lights on the side as  well.
  Some players would perhaps even say that you do not have to read this since  it is obvious that White can do something, thus 'a' must be better than 'b'.  But the correct approach is to read it out since a Black move at 'n' might  work (but you can read ou
t that it do not work in this position) and do not now for sure unless you  check it.]
;W[oo];B[mp];W[op];B[pp];W[nq];B[mq]L[nr][qs]C[This move do no good - it just provoke White 'a' which  threaten 'b' in the endgame. Worse is that since White already have gained a  lot of points here he could take sente and play elsewhere, and that is major  loss.
  Loosing sente in the middlegame is one of the major weaknesses of high-kyu  players.]
;W[nr];B[np]L[oq][pr][gl]C[The  damage is not big but really it just helps White to threaten 'b' with 'a'.  Black should play elsewhere. If he is worried about eyes for the Black group  why not play 'c' a move with at least 4 important meanings. Try to figure  them out for your
self.];W[oq];B[pr]L[li]C[This is an endgame move. If Black is  concerned of attacking the eyeshape of White the area round 'a' is more  interesting but I cannot see anything that look good here anyway so Black  should play elsewhere.]
;W[gm]L[bn][ao][en][hp][ho][ip][jp][hq]C[If Black had played here  instead of playing endgame moves in the corner he had:
1) Defended his Black group in better way
2) Reduced the White territory.
3) Weakened the lower left white Wall. Ba, Wb and Bc...
4) Increased the possibility of doing somethin like Bd, We, Bf, Wg, Bh  creating cutting point above and below 'g'.
5) Getting more power for fighting in the center.];B[eg]L[dg][df][ef]
[ff]C[Bad shape. White can aim at Wa, Bb, and a cut at 'c'. Black 'd' instead  look much better.]
;W[dg];B[df];W[ib]L[ld][ef]C[Strange move.  White has to do better than this since the Black lead is huge. Perhaps White  should invade with 'a' aiming at the cut at 'b' in the following fight.]
;B[jb]C[Good enough.];W[ic];B[jc]L[ld][lc][mf]C[Now White 'a' is hopeless because of Black 'b' which  siply connects. And that would the kindest answer of Black think of Black 'c'  as an example.]
;W[me];B[jf]C[Correct, Black defends inderectly  and take control of the center.]
;W[kg];B[jg];W[kh];B[jh];W[md];B[mc]L[mb][pc][rc]C[Perhaps giving way to  'a' would be best. Hmm,... perhaps K14 was an overplay after all... I am not  sure since the cuts at 'b' and 'c' give Black problems.]
;W[lc];B[mb];W[kd];B[ke]L[id][lb]C[The interesting move here are  'a' and 'b'. There is a risk that White ignore this move. And the gain Black  get from it is not worth the risk.]
;W[le];B[lb];W[eh];B[fg];W[fe];B[ef];W[id]C[White remove this good  point for Black.]
;B[fi]L[gj]C[Dangerous - it could get cut. Black 'a' look  both safer and more efficient.]
;W[fj];B[hi];W[gj];B[gi]C[Too slow, first Black play lightly and then he connects a little  inconsistent]
;W[nj]C[Good point Black had lot of aji here.];B[ik]L[hl][ki]C[An almost valueless point. Black want to play fast with perhaps  Black 'a' shortly followed with 'b'.]
;W[hk]L[bi][bb][ie][ok][hq][hp]C[Defends  agains nothing, since the previous move did not threaten anything as far as I  can see. The big points here are round 'a' and 'b'.  A move at 'c' look urgent as well for both players.  Black 'd' is worth 5 points and threaten a capture for 4 more points.
Black has 'e' and perhaps 'f' as a strong move.];B[ie];W[bh];B[bg];W[bi]
;B[bb];W[ba];B[ac]L[ab][aa]C[In the corner  Black can play 'a' since white cannot play White 'b'. Now White can play 'a'  and threaten a big endgame ko if Black do not safely connect. This is a  common endgame mistake. It is not serious, but we all strive after  perfection, do we
 not? :-)];W[eq];B[dr]L[er][fr][gr][fs][cr][br]C[AAAAAAAAAARGH! Please tell me that  Black did not actually played this on purpose. White cannot cut after Black  'a'. White 'b' fails after Bc, W D2, Bd, We, Bf.
But still efen if the sequence works for White it is almost always better to  play 'a' first and let White capture in got with 'b' and 'c']
;W[er];B[es];W[fs];B[ds];W[fr];B[bs]C[White take 18 -20 points in *sente*. Once  more:
AAAAAAARGHHHH!
If something looses the game I guess this is it. Still it is not completely  lost because Black had a huge lead before this happened.]
;W[kr];B[lr]L[jr]C[The white move is a mistake. Black should play 'a'. The  Black group is not threatened yet.]
;W[jr]C[Black was tricked.];B[jp]L[hl][gl][ki][li][kj][lj]
[jk]C[If Black is worried he could try  to play the sequence beginning with 'a'. If White is kind this result would  be very satisfactory for Black.]
;W[jo];B[kn];W[jq];B[kp]C[Black looses Sente again.];W[re];B[rc];W[ag];B
[bf];W[he];B[hf];W[ge];B[ki];W[li];B[kj];W[lj];B[hl];W[gl];B[jk];W[kf];B
[kc]C[If Black simply connect at K15 he can play this nonurgent  sente move in sente later.]
;W[je]C[Black risk more in this ko  than White];B[if]C[... and has to connect]
;W[ke]C[... And  should perhaps have lost sente again, this move is not big]
;B[rg]L[ia][ja]C[Black should play 'a' in sente protecting against White 'b'  which also is sente. Playing here first is worth at least 3 points and is  double sente which mean that the points are for free for both players. Such  moves cannot be left unplayed!]
;W[ja]C[Good.];B[kb];W[ok];B[rk]C[Black is not reading. This is -1 point in gote. White  cannot do anything here until all Blacks liberties are gone.]
;W[af];B[ae];W[ah];B[be];W[gf];B[gg];W[mr];B[bn]C[Black is desperate he looses at least 4 points if this does  not work.]
;W[ao];B[hm];W[hn];B[in];W[ip];B[jn]C[Only 1 point in reverse sente.];W
[ls]C[3 points in  *sente*.];B[ko]C[Black has problems with his monitor or his mouse  because this move is worth exactly 0 points.]
;W[pg];B[gn];W[ho];B[cl];W[dm];B[ej]C[If it fails Black looses 2  points at least.]
;W[ei];B[dj];W[cj];B[ek];W[el];B[hj];W[gk];B[ck];W[dk];B[bj];W[bk];B[rf]
;W[sf];B[ri]L[sg]C[Black defend two times  here. Black can play at 'a' and White have no aji left (exept kothreats).]
;W[sd];B[sc];W[se];B[dd];W[ed];B[ap];W[oe];B[ne];W[or];B[ps]L[lk]C[Black should play 'a' in sente. The endgame is so small now that White can  soon gain a half a point or so by playing here first.]

[tt];C[Black played good enough in the fuseki and middle  game (even though there is lot to learn of course) to take a big lead. But  the weak spots was revealed in the endgame (perhaps becouse of timetrouble).  Blacks reading crumbled completely in the end
game, and I think that to summarize: Black first lost 20 points in the lower  left, but what is a greater problem (since the corner was just one single  incident) is that after that he lost 15-20 points on many small mistakes in  the endgame.
  The easiest cure is to study the endgame, learn how to evaluate simple  endgame moves correctly, and learn the difference between:
*Gote
*Sente
*Reverse sente
*Double sente

Hint! Read the book The Endgame by Ogawa/Davies.
It will improve your game with 20 points easily. Promise!
