C[White 22 is perhaps better at 'a'.]

C[In the game, White finally had to add a move at 28 to build  eye space and Black got the chance to play the good point of 29. It is quite painful for the white group on the left side.]

C[35 has not appeared often in pro games. Playing at 'a' seems more urgent.]

LB[fi:a]

;W[gj]

C[After 36 gets out, Black's groups on the left side will get weaker.]

;B[mf]

C[37 is obviously a mistake. There is no reason to play in gote and give up the key point 

of 40 to White.]

C[Up to 56, the result is good for White.]

;B[kf]

;W[lf]

;B[lg]

C[Black has realised he is behind, so he played 57 and 59 to separate White. Black wants 

to make the game complicated.]

C[White 76 would be better playing at 'a'. If Black 'b', White 76, Black 'd', White 'e', the 

white group on the upper side is alive. If Black connects his two groups, White could exchange 'f' for 'g', then play elsewhere.]

C[White 76 and 78 are aiming to attack the six black stones.]

LB[pj:a][nf:b][of:c][od:d]

C[Since Black 'a' is sente, Black can play 'b' to 'd' to kill the white group.]

C[White has to make life.]

C[Once Black has strengthened the centre group in sente, coming out with 109 is severe.]

C[111 is not good shape, but it is a good move.]
