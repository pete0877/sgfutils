GC[Game 4



It was a sunny day - almost white light - and the June hillsides at the Engakuji temple were lush green. The sounds of the bombers overhead had gone. There was only the sound of the wind in the cryptomerias. 



The game began at 9.50 am. A red rug had been laid for both players to sit on. Both looked in fine fettle. Kitani had given up his stomach medicine. After meals he still enjoyed his squeezed orange juice but they had to be natsu-mikan oranges and not the bitter daidai, otherwise he got a headache.



The sun was hot and there were water shortages in the capital but here the players could drink from a cool, deep well - which they did, huge glassfuls four times a day.



It was around this time that Go briefly used the name Go Izumi - half-Chinese, half-Japanese. Most Japanese wrongly read it as fully Japanese, Kure Izumi, but Go was indeed bending towards the Japanese style. With war raging on mainland China, he was worried about his nationality. He had decided to follow a friend's advice and make his name at least partly Japanese. But there was regret over the loss of the harmonious phrase Kitani-Go Seigen. Go was later urged to use Seigen again as an artistic name. Kitani urged it too as sounding more youthful.]

;B[pd];W[cd];B[pp]

C[Black 1 and 3 were expected. Go was almost invincible at that time with this opening. But Kitani had something prepared.]

;W[dq];B[ed]

C[Black 5 could also be the triple-star formation at A.

]LB[pj:A]

;W[dc]

C[Kitani muttered "Odd, odd" then exclaimed "New opening!" as he played 6. The observer, Mihori Sho, expected A, B or C and was surprised, so he looked at both players' faces.



6 is pure Kitani style. But there is no reason to think it is superior, said Sakata Eio, to the usual pattern starting at A. Kitani said at the time: "White 6 and so on was said to be bad for White, but if 6 is at A I felt Black could play the avalanche joseki starting at D, and I disliked this. It was a time when the avalanche joseki had not been studied as it has today and I definitely had a feeling of wanting to avoid it. So I dared to try White 6."

]LB[dd:D][hd:C][gc:B][ec:A]



(;B[ec]

C[Black almost has to play the common-sense 7  - though Go said he did consider playing elsewhere, for example at 'a' {but then would White play B?!}. But White clearly has his next move prepared: it could be C, 'a' or D. Go had to guess which it would be.



Black 7 is common sense because it aims at two options: Black E or F.



Mihori at the time was speculating about variation 'a'  >> but common sense ruled.

]LB[ce:E][de:D][jc:F][cf:C][cp:B][do:A]



(;W[de]

C[White 8 - as Go expected: A would have too little impact on Black.



If White skips this area, for example to play 'a', Black will punish him >>

]LB[cf:A]

;B[jc]

C[Black 9 is here rather than A to achieve balance with the star stone - it gives Black an ideal move whichever way White attacks his upper right corner: if B then C, or if D then E, C, F.



The feeling was that the sequence in the left could not be regarded as joseki because White's play was too reminiscent of the ultracautious way Black would play in a handicap game.]

LB[pf:F][oc:E][nc:D][nd:C][qf:B][ic:A]

;W[co];B[jq];W[qf];B[nd]

C[Black 13: pincering immediately at A is also valid.

]LB[qh:A]

;W[rd]

C[White 14 would normally be a three-space extension to A, and Kitani also conceded: "White 14 could also probably go there to map out territory."

]LB[qj:A]

;B[qh]

C[The pincer of Black 15 is natural for Go as A would be too much like a handicap player being forced - White would then play B. He adopts a framework-making strategy instead. Go prefers to keep sente.



But Kitani, implying he might have played it himself, said that of course Black 15 could also be at the 3-3 point, A. After White B, Black C or D is reasonable.]

LB[gq:D][fq:C][qi:B][qc:A]

;W[qc]

C[White 16: if at A, then Black plays 16 but now the pincer is in place.

]LB[of:A]



;B[qe]

C[Black 17 was so obvious it was played at once.]

(;W[re]

C[White 18 was also played at once, but Kitani at once regretted his impulsiveness. He wished he'd looked more at 'a' - then a novel idea.

];B[pf]

C[Also played at once.]

(;W[nb]

C[About 18 months earlier, these two players had played almost the same opening. Colours were reversed but Go was still the side pincering, and the only difference was that White - in that game - had the marked stone at A instead. But because of that difference, the player on the side had to play 'c' rather than as in this game.



But there were still alternatives for White 20, and Kitani spent 20 minutes deciding. Since 20 in the game is gote and White would like to get to B first, one choice was variation >> 'a'. Another was variation >> 'b'. 



Sakata said he would want to play the nidanbane at >> 'c'. 



Both players took off their haori jackets. The noon sun was burning.

]LB[qn:B][nc:A]

TR[nd]

;B[rf]

C[Black 21 is sente. And, because it is sente, it is the only move.



It threatens, amongst other things, the sequence starting at - A-. If White answers A at D, Black has the option of playing B or C.

]LB[rc:G][oa:F][qb:E][pb:D][pc:C][oc:B][ob:A]

;W[oc]

C[Kitani said of White 22, "Although White has to put up with gote here compared with 20 at A, he has to do it to destroy Black's territory."



Fujisawa Hosai added that White 22 is also to confirm his corner profit and if you have confidence in what comes later you can say nothing against it.



But Fujisawa and Sakata Eio said, nevertheless, that the pattern up to White 22 feels rather poor for White. 

]LB[ob:A]

;B[pn]

C[Black 23: Aye, there's the rub was Kitani's reaction to this...

];W[ko]

C[... so he sent in a bomber - a common thought then - with 24. This kind of move was his speciality. He played such moves a lot at the time. He would like Black to submit with A, then White invades and lives at B. 



White 24 also challenges Black's framework at the top. He must do this before Black gets a chance to play C.

]LB[jo:C][qq:B][lp:A]



(;B[eq]

C[Black 25: Go counterattacks. If Black answers submissively at 'a', White would invade the corner  - see variation >>. Not only is this normally good for White, but in this game in particular White would have all four corners. Also, White would have a follow-up move at 'b' to make a central framework as well.

 

If Black answers 24 with 'b' instead, White will be content with the variation >> shown. 



Going the other way with 25 was therefore "natural", said Kitani.

]LB[ip:B]

;W[ep];B[fq];W[dr];B[fp]

(;W[eo]

C[White 30: solid defence Kitani spent 34 minutes on it. He was

also considering variation 'a' >> but he found it unattractive,

mainly because he will have to submit tamely to the atari at

30, but also because the marked stone was played as a probe,

and he wants to preserve it in that role - Black still has to

declare his intentions.

]TR[ko]

;B[jo]

C[But Go played 31 precisely to forestall A. It gave Kitani

pause for thought and he gulped down a glass of water, remarking

that it seemed as he was being swallowed whole, too. Black is

taking a very positive stance. But then White's reply was to

prove a sharp

rejoinder.



Go said afterwards he should therefore now have played B,

even though it felt "strange", instead of 31 to justify his previous

moves in this area.



Go did anticipate how White would respond to this move.  It was

his evaluation that he revised after the game: "The jump to Black

31 was an overplay." He went even further in later years and

said he was outplayed in the opening because of Black 31.

]LB[io:A][ip:B]



(;W[jp]

C["A sharp response, said Fujisawa Hosai.  "White can get good

momentum for handling his group." Any other move by White would

be too slack.



White 32 at 'a'  instead does not stand up here, said Fujisawa - see variation >> 'a'.

]

(;B[kp]

C[Forced. Black 33: if at 'a' instead, see >> variation.



];W[ip];B[iq]

(;W[hq]

C[A move Kitani was proud of. Go overlooked it, perhaps.



The alternative at 'a' for 36 was not good - see variation >>

]

(;B[hp]

C[Playing 37 below at 'a' >> is awful for Black.



Black 37 at >> 'b' would be a strong reply, but...



So Black has no option but to cut and capture with 37.

];W[io];B[ho];W[in]

C[ Kitani said: "Black has been outplayed."

];B[hr]

C[Fujisawa said that Black was right to be be patient with 41.



If 41 is omitted, White can play there and aim at the connection

at A, with the aji of B also to look forward to.



If 41 is at C, as Black would like, White gets a more vital

point at B, and Black still has to go back to 41 anyway,

as he cannot let White play there, for otherwise White's domain

on the left side becomes too powerful.

]LB[gs:A][hn:B][lp:C]

;W[lp];B[kq];W[ln]

C[Kitani: "I felt I was doing all right after White 42 and 44."

These are thick moves, building a bridgehead in Black's framework.

White can be assumed to have got the better of the fighting so

far. Already Black's prospects are looking difficult.



If White 44 is at A, Black can immediately play B.

]LB[lo:A][jn:B]

;B[hn]

C[Black 45 is to set up A next but it has its demerits: although

Black gets this push in, he is overconcentrated on the left and

White has already secured a firm footing in the heart of Black's

framework. Being dragged into an early fight is also against

Black's interest. At this stage the game is not looking easy

for him. Black must play here, because if White gets to play

it Black will have no opportunity to move out. But pushes his

head out also makes White thicker.

]LB[dj:A]



;W[im]

C[Tewari shows that White has effectively made the exchange of

the marked stones - a trivial loss - but in return has made Black

push him twice into the centre.



Nevertheless, Kitani later said 46 should have been the capture

atA because of the relationship with the right side - it

gave Black a peep at B.



Go felt outplayed after 46 - a rare occasion.

]LB[jn:A][km:B]

TR[hq][hr]

;B[dj]

C[Black 47: Kitani said, "Now that Black has got sente, it is difficult

to know where to play. But at any rate he has to prevent White

from turning the left side into territory."



But the Black 47 chosen was yet another questionable move, said

Go. "Black 47 was unsatisfactory because it let White repair

his thinness on the left side at A. But if he doesn't play

47 White can play there and still map out territory, so perhaps

it is inevitable. I thought it was a good point."



Fujisawa remarked that this 47 simply induces

White 48. If he wants to play on the left side the normal point

would be B. Go, however, said 47 should have been at C, White D, Black 47, but he didn't play that because it

makes his top side thin.



Perversely, Kitani said 47 was a good point. He has to play here

anyway otherwise White gets it, he said. The observer, Mihori

Sho, expected E for 47.



Note that 47 aims at F, implying moves such as G, B or C.

]LB[dh:A][cg:B][dg:C][ee:D][ff:E][dd:F][cf:G]

;W[dh]

C[Kitani was playing quite fast up to here, like Go - a sign of

his confidence, good form or just learning to use his time better,

mused the Nihon Ki-in manager Yahata Kyosuke. It was still the

first day with more than an hour to go before the sealed move.



White 48: another possibility was A, to aim at B.

]LB[dg:A][gd:B]

;B[mo];W[lo];B[ll]

C[Black wants to attack so as to build up his

framework on the right - he is threatening A. But as White

is thick, Black can generate no real momentum to do this.



The cap at Black 51, typical of Go's large-scale style, looks

forward to the forcing move next at B and is spot on. Still,

since White has chosen to go for thickness, Black cannot get

any leverage to proceed with much momentum. 



Black 51 at C would be the humdrum idea but White D would

be bigger than it looks - as the game will show.

]LB[nl:A][km:B][ql:C][lq:D]

;W[ql]

C[A good point for invasion. White is taking advantage of the fact

that Black has no momentum to his attack.

];B[km]

C[This is a forcing move.

];W[kn]

C[White 54 is the right response even though it is bad shape, because

it keeps one eye.

]

(;B[rn]

C[Black 55 above all assures Black's territory but also denies

White a base.  In attacking White the first issue to be settled

is to take away his base for eyes.



Capping at 'a' instead lets White get a live shape >>



One thought after the game was that Black 55 may have been better

at >> 'b'.

]

(;W[nl]

C[For White 56 Kitani said he considered variation >> 'a'.

];B[mm]

C[Black 57 is the only move to split and attack White. It is a

necessary but painful shape.

];W[mj]

C[White 58 required 20 minutes. It is a nice, subtle move, and

is good shape. Kitani's handling of the stones around here has

been very light

and brilliant.

];B[nm]

C[When Go played 59, after 23 minutes, he remarked it was a Kato

Shin move - safety first, defending against the possibility of

White A but creating a springboard for attack.



Black 59 is a honte. It creates the miai of connecting at B or attacking on the right.

]LB[on:A][mq:B]



(;W[pi]

C[White 60 is the correct point to make shape. He would have liked

to have found a move to prevent

Black playing B, but where? And could he make it outweigh

letting his three stones come under attack? 



In fact 60 offers a sente move next because C forces Black

D or leaves the aji of E, so it will be that much easier

for him to settle his group. He would have had to have been a

brave man to omit 60.



If White 60 stops the connection by playing 'a', he will be in

danger as shown >>



The players also discussed these points the next day after the

sealed move - see the comments after Black 61.

]LB[mq:B][ph:C][qg:D][qi:E]

;B[mq]

C[Black 61, which took 23 minutes, was the sealed move on the first

day.  It takes a

big profit, though White 62 next is the trade off.



Black 61 is played in sente and finally converts his framework

into some territory. It also attacks White.



When he saw the sealed move next day,

Kitani, looking hard at his opponent, mused out loud whether

he should have played in that area himself instead of 60. Go

said he thought Kitani might have played a knight's move there

- that is White A then Black B. But Kitani, who didn't

like knight moves, said if he had played there he would have

gone straight down to C. But he was chary then of the attack

on his three stones. By opting for the right  side he got some

sort of attack, he said. But he rattled his fan as he gazed at

the lower right corner and commented that it looked like a big

secure territory. It was clearly a tormenting point. Nevertheless

White does have the other three corners as territory so we can

say there is territorial balance.

]LB[ik:A][nq:A][oq:B][lq:C]

;W[ik]

C[After the sealed move the players had returned to their lodgings

at the Kofu-en in Kanameyama and Kawabata Yasunari, the future

Nobel Prize winner and author of Meijin, joined them. He was an

amateur 1- dan and lived closeby. The players trooped off to

bed just after 10 but Kawabata stayed up with Mihori analysing

the game. What struck them was the pace of the game - Go was

using more time than usual - and the good form of Kitani.



White 62 - 36 minutes. Otherwise Black plays here and White collapses.

];B[cn]

C[Black 63: alert - typical of Go's style. Attaching here before

switching to A is the hallmark of Go's fast-paced style.

It has been observed that Go makes more contact plays than other

players.



63 is a probe and it also is meant to work with the marked stone.

It is one of the highest class moves in this game - the one to

appreciate and learn from above all.



See the comments after 64, 65 and 66 to see why this move is

so good.

]LB[kj:A]

TR[dj]



(;W[bn]

C[White 64 - 32 minutes. If White plays on top at > 'a', Black

gets the momentum to settle his shape in this area.



Kitani's chagrined response to playing 64 was that he had been

forced. But Go countered by saying it was a loss for him, that

is having to use up a forcing move. The debate here is very much

on a high pro plane.



Fujisawa Hosai commented that it was fascinating how both players'

characteristic qualities are being expressed here.

]

(;B[kj]

C[Black can now play this on the back of some aji left in the corner,

starting with >> 'a'.



65 splits White in two. Kitani now has to show his fighting spirit.

];W[cm]

C[Kitani is on his mettle. He lets Black attack, but look how lonely

the black stone above now looks.



Coolly gripping with 66 - which took 21 minutes - is thick and

typical of Kitani's style. Nevertheless, Black is not entirely

dissatisfied. The marked exchange, in which in tewari terms the

moves cancel each other out without loss for Black, has forced

has White to hold back from extending to A.]

TR[cn][bn]LB[cl:A]

;B[ph]

C[Black 67 starts the attack. White's shape is thin but resilient,

so he can settle himself easily with A. Even so, Black 67

appeals because it takes away a choice for White - 67 or A. But Go wondered

after the game whether he should have gone straight into somewhere

like B. 



Still, as Kitani observed, the issue here is not really

the attack on this white group the one on the group in the lower

centre and the possible development of a black moyo at the top.

Which is why Go plays as he does.



There was some regret by Kitani that Black was able to play here

67 with sheer profit, or oshitoku, 

because White had had the chance to play in this area first.

The problem for Kitani, though, was knowing whether to play 67

or A and so he left it until he could make a rational choice.

]LB[qi:A][pk:B]

;W[om]

C[White 68 - no loss, so worth playing.

];B[on];W[mh]

(;B[kh]

C[Black 71 is a bit too plain, in a worthless area, said Go, and

perhaps was better at variation >> 'a'.



But Kitani disagreed. He pointed out that 71 puts pressure on

the white group below and gives strong support to the black group

in the upper left.

];W[qi]

C[White 72 more or less assures White of a live shape. Kitani spent

30 minutes checking.

];B[ol];W[oh]

C[White 74: 47 minutes. If he omits this, Black gouges him out

with A. If he plays B, Black is likely to play elsewhere.

]LB[pk:A][ok:B]

;B[ee]

C[Black 75: gets this push in in case he doesn't get a chance later

- it is big for White to play there - even though it settles

the shapes, explained Go.



It was now 3pm on the second day. The game has become much easier

for Black in that he appears now to have a clear way to help

his lone marked stone on the left. White of course is in a strong

position to fight, but he is about to come under pressure.

]TR[dj]

;W[df];B[og]

C[Black 77: A is the vital point here, but letting White play

77 would destroy Black's shape in an area where White has a very

solid corner.



But White is about to settle himself easily and so this 77 ends

up useless for Black. White has no worries now and there is a

feeling that Black has been led by the nose under White's amashi

strategy in this area. This perhaps explains why Go was dissatisfied

with the marked stone.

]LB[ok:A]

TR[kh]

;W[oj]

C[White's marked stone and 78 are a fixed pattern for such cases

to ensure eye shape.

]TR[oh]

;B[nh]

;W[ni];B[oi]

C[Black 81: Go said later he should have played A Kitani gave

a little grimace and said he wasted a lot of time thinking about

whether or not to take this ko.

]LB[ng:A]

;W[ok]

C[White 82: relief. Virtually alive, but Black has become very

solid round about. Black's strongest attack here is at A,

White - B, Black C but he is reluctant to play it yet as

he has other aims.

]LB[rj:A][ri:B][rl:C]



(;B[gk]

C[B83 is a good move and illuminating of Go's style. It is hard

for White to answer. It combines attack on the white group below

and defence of the marked stone.



Since Black has no attack on the right, it is natural anyway

for him to turn to the centre group.



Kitani's explanation of why Black cannot take

away White's eyes at once with 83 on the right was that if Black

plays A White defends at B. Then C and D are

miai and White is assured of two eyes.



What is really afoot on the right is a threat by Black to play

E, White F, Black G. But so long as Black is thin

on the outside this White group can probably live.



Indeed, White has an aim of his own, especially if he gets A or H in: I, Black J, White K,  looking  at L.



83 is better than 'a' because 'a' leaves a cut >>.

]LB[pm:A][rk:B][rm:C][mk:D][rj:E][ri:F][rl:G][pl:H][mp:I][nq:J][np:K][nn:L]

TR[dj]



(;W[gl]

C[White counterattacks, exploiting the solidity of the marked stone

to get life for his centre group.



The various alternatives are inferior. Variation >> 'a' allows

Black a sente move at 'b'.  White >> 'b' lets Black get good

shape to the left. White >> 'c'  lets Black connect or get sente.

The peep at White >> 'd'  is certainly no loss for White if Black

connects, but it is not inviting given that Black has already

taken the marked ko.



The position is not easy to judge. To some eyes,  the advantage

of first move seemed to have been maintained and White is under

some pressure.

There is no big difference in the balance of territories.  But

Black does not have an easy game, and the next few moves show

how Go is feeling - they are a desperate way to seek a fight.

]TR[oi][cm]

;B[hl]

C[A or B just open the door for White.

]LB[fl:A][fm:B]

;W[hm]

(;B[il]

C[Black breaks through on one side and offers some security to

the marked stone on the other.



Variation >> 'a' fails because of an oi-otoshi.

]TR[dj]



(;W[fm]

C[If White 88 is at variation 'a', Black just gets more territory.



Or if 88 is at 'b', he has no good continuation, and the worry

is he may end in gote.

];B[hk]

C[After Black 89 both sides have settled all their groups. But

looking at the result it cannot be denied that White has succeeded

in running rings round Black.

];W[ff]

C[90 comes out with good momentum. White can be satisfied

with his posture. As he played 90 Kitani said he was playing like Suzuki

Tamejiro, his teacher, making a thick move.



Go's head was sunk low over the board. As it had come up to the

agreed time of 4.30, it was going to be the sealed move next.

To help him Kitani stood up, took off his hakama and went into

the corridor.



Go had already thought for 20 minutes. He added 13 more before

he was ready. Just then Kitani came back. Go looked up and

said, "What do you think, Kitani-san? Wouldn't it

be better to play the peep and capture and seal the

next move?"



If Go, as Black, sealed A here he could guarantee B and

the effect would be to suspend the game at move B, giving Black

time to think about his response to that. There had been cases

of such behaviour, and Go did not want to invite scandal.

But Kitani dissented: it's wrong to agree moves by discussion,

he said. So in the end Go sealed A.

]LB[jn:B][jm:A]

(;B[jm]

C[Black 91 took 33 minutes before it was sealed.



The reason White 90 was thick can be seen if Black tries >> 'a'

instead.

];W[jn]

C[The third day began with Kitani slightly lame - he had cut a

toe on his right foot and it needed some treatment.



Go was expecting a hard day too as the endgame was scheduled

for 9 in the morning to 11 in the evening.



There was a laughing group of primary schoolchildren on a study

trip to look at the Daizensatsu on the other side of the cryptomerias

far below. In the playing room the sliding shoji doors were thrown

wide open. Under the bright sun light the stones made perfect

black and white contrast.



The two players replayed the moves of the previous day quickly

and with occasional slip-ups. Hagiwara the scorer opened the

sealed move. Of course it was 91 and Kitani captured at 92 without

bothering to think.]

(;B[db]

C[What's possible for Black 93?



One issue is whether or not it is better for Black to play the

atari at A.



Also he would like to do something about the top in response

to the marked stone but without impacting on the centre too much.

So what about the sequence B, C, D. Or simply E?



Variation 'a' is highly problematical.



Black 93 to 97, defending, are the soundest plays. Kitani admired

this choice.

]LB[hd:E][gd:D][fg:C][fh:B][fl:A]

TR[ff]

;W[cb];B[dd];W[cc];B[gc];W[kc]

C[Once Black has defended at the marked stone, White no longer

has an invasion to aim at, so he attaches at 98, taking up the

miai point. 

He will have no regrets about strengthening Black here. 98

also prevents Black A, which would seal White in.



This tesuji took 49 minutes.

]LB[mb:A]

TR[gc]



(;B[fl]

C[Go, according to Kitani's recollection, said after the game that

it was better not to play 99.  Go in fact said later it was a

terrible move. He didn't want to have to worry about White -

A -, but the price

he paid was to have the marked stone cut off and captured.





The variations are difficult, but Sakata also said A was

not to be feared, and therefore 99 was unnecessary. See variation

>> 'a', which is what Go said he should have played. Black was

probably then ahead, he thought. But Kitani said he would have

been happy to see Black reply to 'a' because it would have meant

Black had been forced and he would have interfered with the possibility

of Black sealing off this area with B, which is big.



If 99 is at 'b' , White defends as shown in the variation >>.

]LB[mb:B][fk:A]

TR[dj]

;W[gm];B[kb]

C[Black 101 was perhaps an overplay. It avoids White settling this

area as would happen with the variations just mentioned, but

it gives White forcing moves that help in the fight below.

];W[jb]

C[White's crosscut 102 took 29 minutes, but is a standard sacrificial

tesuji as preparation for fighting. With it, he forces Black

in sente

into overconcentrated shape and prepares to fight in the centre

with - A- and B. 



By now both players had their haori jackets off, ready for decisive

action.

]LB[fj:B][ej:A]

;B[ib]

C[Black 103: the first idea, but could he get in the atari at A first?



Black must also think about replying by extending towards

the enemy at B, the opposite of the usual direction, though

then he would have to worry about White C.

]LB[hc:C][lb:B][lc:A]

C[Black would like to answer at >> 'a' but the crosscut has foiled

that...

];W[ic];B[jb]

C[Around here was a difficult point in the game - the crux of the

middle game. But perhaps White got slightly the better of this

103-107 exchange, being more active.



Tewari shows that effectively Black has been forced to submit

to a low position. However you view it, the crosscut sacrifice

stone played at the point 107 now occupies has not been wasted.



Note also that White's three stones are light  - they have done

their job of forcing Black and can now be sacrificed if necessary.

So White does not have to add any more moves here yet.  Compare

this with Black simply playing 99 at 107.



If Black A instead, White will  play sacrificially at - B

-. Similarly if Black plays C or - D. The twin prongs of

White's marked stones exert laser-like power, so Black can't

expect much territory here.

C[White 108 took 42 minutes.

];B[ek];W[fj]

C[Right, let's go, said Kitani, playing 110 at once and showing

his confidence after long thought. He is about to cut off the

stone on the star point. The situation has become confused. Go

grumbled about his error in atari-ing at 99.

];B[fk]

C[To rub salt in the wound, Black has ended up with an empty triangle

- further condemnation of 99.



Note that the marked stone still has value!

]TR[hq]

;W[dk]

C[White had favourable prospects up to now, but this cut definitely

puts him in the lead. Now Kitani is making all the running.

(;B[dl]

C[Go spent just one minute on Black 113 - impulsive rashness untypical

of him. He could have broken into White's territory if he had

played variation >> 'a' at once, Go said later.



He could also have simply played  variation >> 'b'.



But at the time he was fixated on White's cutting stone D9 and

too ready to fight.

];W[ck];B[em];W[fo]

C[The reason White can respond to Black 115 as here is that Black

culpably played the marked atari exchange. Had he not, White

could only play at A.

]LB[fn:A]

TR[gm][fl]



(;B[fh]

C[Despite his rashness with the marked stone, 113, Go still gets

the vital point of 117, a tesuji, and Kitani didn't like it -

he drained his cup of water and settled down to think.



If 117 is at >> 'a'...



]TR[dl]



(;W[gj]

C[White 118,  the strongest resistance as it fills in a liberty.

took 30 minutes.  "I don't know but...", said Kitani as he played

it.  He had pondered over the kosumi A instead.



Go did not respond to the implicit query as to which was better

but was staring at the area round B.



If White replies for safety at variation >> 'a', Black makes

himself thick in the centre with the prospect of a large territory

there - not good for White. Black gets a similar boost if White

plays 118 at A.



Kitani was on his third fan - he would typically pound one to

death every day and he would have five ready for the Oteai. Go

hardly used a fan at this time, because it was troublesome. He

couldn't be bothered with fiddly things - for the same reason

he hardly wore glasses then as they were bifocals.

]LB[cl:B]

;B[hj]

C[Black 119 was played immediately. No choice, said Go, as he played

it.

];W[gi]

C[The idea of 120 was that if next Black A then White B.

If

Black B, then White A. Either way spoils Black's centre.

]LB[hi:B][hh:A]

;B[cl]

C[This probe obviously comes to mind first for 121. Will White

defend

at A or will he give way? If White A, Black has the aji

of B but how can he use it? Not easy.



There is nothing interesting here for Black in playing C,

White -B -.

]LB[ef:C][di:B][bl:A]

;W[bl];B[ei]

C[Black 123, a tesuji, is attempting to squeeze White.

]

(;W[gh]

C[White 124 keeps up the pressure. If he cuts at >> 'a' he gets

squeezed.





];B[di]

(;W[ci]

C[White 126 is necessary because Black has a secret aim, namely

the ko in variation >> 'a'. White 126 is the vital point control

the invasion through shortage of liberties.



Go later told Mihori he would have liked White to play 126 at

variation >> 'b'. But Kitani admitted he hadn't worked this move

out. He just dismissed it on principle - it was not a logical

move because it let Black strike inside at A. Therefore 126

was the only move. It is perhaps odd that two top players' reading

could differ so markedly yet lead to the same result. Anyway,

126 was a real danger point for White. 



The outcome has become even more obscure. Black now has two options.

One is to recklessly demolish the white moyo on the left, and

the other is to throw in some sacrifices stones there to try

to get momentum to expand the black moyo in the centre. It follows

that White's strategy is to protect his left moyo while seeking

to spoil Black's central one.

]LB[cg:A]

;B[fg]

(;W[eh]

C[Black lets White play the tesuji of 128 to sacrifice three stones

so he can break into White's territory.



But, overall, things are not hopeful for Black. If 128 is at

>> 'a', Black will break through and enclose the corner

completely or save his three stones and so capture white's in

the centre. Either way is worse than the game. So 128 must come

before 'a'.

]

(;B[eg]

C[The irregular Black 129 shows he is in difficulties, as Go admitted. Yet such desperate moves are

hard to play against, Kitani said. Go saw that trying

to turn the centre black would not work.

Once White plays A he can connect to either marked stone.



Black's move order is skilful. 'a' is out because White will kill the whole group. By first playing

129, Black is inviting White to defend at B, then when

Black plays 'a', points 'b' and 'c' are miai for him. 



Still, the obvious 129 is 'b', or maybe 'c'. Both are met by 'a'. 

White will be pleased to lop off three stones, though Black need not feel too bad.



Or, instead of 129, simply Black 'c' would be a par exchange, Go admitted. 



There has been no slack in the fighting here but

Black is still behind. Yet this is not where the game will

be decided. That depends on what White can do with C. To win, he must find the best

way to encroach here.

]LB[kd:A][cg:B][lq:C]

TR[nb][mh]

;W[fi];B[dg];W[cj];B[cg]

C[Black 133: looking at this Kitani exclaimed with delight, "He's

lost his temper!" In other words, Black has gone the whole hog

of invading White's side.



An amateur would be delighted to do this - here it is the "victim"

who is delighted. 133 does indeed

reduce White's side by 10 points, so it is big, and moves like

Black A remain to threaten White's eye shape. However, the

down side is that Black's five stones are weak and thin. Attacking

these stones will let White lay waste to any plans Black has

about taking the centre.

]LB[be:A]

;W[ef];B[gg]

C[Black's now six-stone group resembles a dragonfly both in shape

and the fact that it too has a precarious hold on life.

];W[gd]

C[White 136 took 39 minutes and is a tesuji. Kitani's skill is

superb. He aims at attacking the dragonfly with A. But Go's

answer showed he was confident of making life above.

]LB[hg:A]

;B[fb]

;W[da]

C[White 138: will Black fight a ko? The loss would be horrendous

for him if he lost it. Connecting at A is safer for the dragonfly

group below. Disengagement has not been possible here but the

problem of B still looms large.

White's eye shape.

];W[ie];B[if]

C[White 150 was a terrible move - Kitani's sorrow. "A move I painfully

regretted", he said. Because it lets Black skip to 'a', White

cannot omit B.



150 should have been at >> 'a'. 

]LB[be:B]

;B[kf];W[be]

C[Black's marked stone removed any chance of a White eye in the

centre, so White has to come back here 152. The difference is

enough to turn the game.

White 152 is necessary otherwise Black will play there.



When White played this it was time for the evening meal. In the

recess Kitani was evidently in high spirits as Go remarked with

a grim laugh. But there was a shock in store for Kitani in the

first move of the evening session.

]TR[kf]

;B[mp]

C[With sente, Black turns to 153 - very big and thick. The difference is now small but Black has achieved

an upset. Kitani's face was as expressive

as a stream of oaths as it dawned how big his mistake

on 150 was - the white marked stone. He could have had it

in sente before he started in the top left. He muttered

that he should have played the black marked stone to keep sente.

Black then plays at the other marked point, of course.



The size of the reverse sente play 153 - in those days called

quasi sente and explained as reverse gote! - was

6 points. The bottom black territory now exceeds 40 points.

The rest of his territories are all less than 10 points. White

has 30+ in the lower left, a trace on the right, nearly 10 in

the top right, about 8 in the top left.

          

Go said 50 years later that had White got 153 in he would have

won. Black got it and so the game was close, though he was unable to read the win out to the end.

]TR[jh][kf]

;W[kg]

C[But of course White gets to play this, which is also sente. This

is skilful invasion-cum-endgame play by White.

];B[lg];W[jg]

C[White 156 erases the territory Black could have got had he played

at A. But Black will still get some territory when he cuts

at B so he does not make much of a loss here.

C[The difference between White 176, which makes a 10-point territory,

and Black playing here is big. However, since there were no mistakes

it was by the merest amount. Kitani was muttering to himself here that he was losing.

];B[qm];W[rl]

did. Both then filled in the neutral points and carefully arranged the territories. Black won by 1 point.



Kitani, out of his slump and at the top of his form, still couldn't

shift Go, invincible with Black. Kitani had played

splendidly but was left with nothing but regrets. It was

a turning point.



In his book "My Go" Kitani said, "After losing

Game 4 I was absolutely mortified. To be overtaken and finally

suffer an upset in a game

where you already have what should be an unassailable lead has

to be put down to inexperience. Although mentioning

it again is a bit unmanly, if I had managed to win and not

be confused, it would have been all square at 2-2, and the match

then would have taken a different course. All merits and demerits originate in

and are attributable to the individual, which is what games

are all about, I cannot but think of that thing

called Fate in a game as important as this."
