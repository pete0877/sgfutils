;B[qd];W[qp];B[dc];W[ce];B[co]

C[Go, then 13, had already mastered the Shusaku fuseki by studying

old Japanese books on his own. From this time until his invention

with Kitani of the New Fuseki six years later, he too earned

the title of "Invincible with Black".

(;W[ep]

C[Common sense in this fuseki. If >> 'a' instead... 

];B[eo]

(;W[do]

C[Probably an attempt to test the youngster's skill. The >> variation

'a' is quieter.]

(;B[dp]

C[If Black blocks at 'a', it is another joseki >> ....

];W[dn];B[cp]

(;W[eq]

C[Since White has to play here, it seems somewhat unreasonable

for him.  Indeed, even if the ladder works and White can play

>> 'a', the outcome seems to favour Black in Go Seigen's eyes

- he favours territory. 

];B[fo];W[cn];B[gq];W[cr];B[bn];W[bm];B[br]

(;W[dr]

C[Lacking in resourcefulness. Once Black has attached at the marked

stone, the proper order of moves is to attach at >> 'a', and

then there are many variations.

;B[fq];W[fp];B[gp];W[dq];B[gs];W[cs]

C[Black ends up with sente. 

];B[oq]

C[The overall position is now rather straightforward for Black.

Taking the division in the lower left as equal, the shapes in

the upper left and lower right are roughly similar, and the effect

is that Black has been able to keep the marked stone in the upper

right unchallenged.

]TR[qd]

;W[po];B[ed];W[dg]

;B[mp]

C[This balanced and calm style of mimic play by Black obviously

leaves White with few opportunities. 

];W[oc];B[kc];W[pe];B[qe]

(;W[pg]

C[Perhaps White should have played at >> 'a' to get sente. 

];B[pf];W[of];B[qf];W[og];B[pc]

(;W[nd]

C[A slack move. He must play >> 'a'...

];B[hd]

C[Very alert. Once the exchange of marked stones has taken place,

- A - is no longer sente against the corner. This kind of fleet-footedness

has been the kernel of Go's style from his early Shusaku-style

days, through the New Fuseki days, right down to the later Three

Stars formation.

]LB[qg:A]

TR[pc][nd]

;W[qg];B[nm]

C[A fine response and exquisite insight. Once White has blocked

at the marked point, the White territory on the right is looking

ominously big.  But, assessing the game as a whole, Black does

not want to invade here. If it is a territory surrounding game,

he has enough.

]TR[qg]

;W[iq]

C[He has no choice but to invade as he would be behind in a straightforward

territory-surrounding game. 

];B[hq];W[jo];B[kq]

C[The vital point. If he lets White play here, not only would he

be giving White a base but his own position would be full of

holes. 

];W[jl]

;B[qr]

C[White has merely jumped into empty space at the marked point,

whereas Black 59 has taken a big point and useful territory.

Black's strategy is beyond reproach.

]TR[jl]

;W[pl]

C[White 60 is somewhat defensive, and there is a feeling that White

is being enclosed. His territory may look large, but if Black

gets the endgame play at - A - it is not worth much more than

20 points. 



Black had clearly seen all this when he played 53 {marked}. 

]LB[rq:A]

TR[nm]

;B[ol]

C[By being willing to force White here, Black shows he has already

a definite plan in mind. 

];W[pk];B[hl]

C[Black's plan is to attack White's marked centre group in order

to aim at invasion at - A -.  



But White has no obvious way to give his centre group any shape,

so he seems stuck, with no way forward or back. 

]LB[di:A]

TR[jl][jo][iq]

;W[np]

C[It seems White has no option but to try to exploit Black's thinness

between the marked stones.  



However, as events will show, he should have simply surrounded

territory at - A - or - B -. 

]LB[di:A][ei:B]

TR[mp][nm]

;B[no];W[mo]

C[The crosscut goes against the grain but is inevitable here. 

];B[mn];W[lo]

;B[op];W[lp];B[nq];W[lq];B[lr];W[kr];B[jr];W[kp]

C[It is better for White not to play this out so that he can aim

at - A - later.  He should just make his next move straight away.

]LB[mr:A]

;B[jq];W[ln]

;B[di]

C[A very severe invasion. By being able to play here Black has

made his advantage clear. 

];W[bc]

(;B[dk]

C[Could also be simply >> 'a'.]

;W[dl];B[bk];W[ck];B[cj];W[ek];B[ej];W[fk];B[gj]

C[This works but proper technique is simply to play at - A -. 

]LB[eh:A]

;W[hi];B[eh];W[bg];B[jj]

C[Good, taking up the high ground in the centre. 

];W[mm]

C[Proper style is to play - A -.

This counterthrust gives Black the right momentum.

the marked stones.

C[Has the twin aims of invasion at the top and pulling out at -

A -. But in fact his only chance of creating something was to

pull out at - A - at once. 

]LB[ii:A]

;B[mj];W[im];B[ii]

C[This combination of forcing move and capture decides the final

outcome. 

];W[gn]

C[If White expected Black - A - next he was being complacent. He

ends up with no profit and only damage to himself.

end.

]LB[ib:A]

;B[ai];W[bl];B[hb]

C[White has scooped out Black's territory in sente, but in return

Black has acquired thickness in the centre and maintained the

territorial balance.  White has no hope.

C[A big endgame play in sente.

right side.

after Black 180, he just engineers an excuse to resign.

enclosure at - A - for Black and the extension at - B - for White.

Black a secure base from which to pincer at - C -.
