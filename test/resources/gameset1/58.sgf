C[one-space jump is better; the 2-space is really not my style]

C[b gets some good thickness; W kind of lost focus here]

C[I think L11 is better (see var)]
;B[jp]
(;W[me]
C[looks good, but it gives B too much territory. M14 is better \
(see var)]
;B[ld];W[kf]
C[W had to take another move here, but the moyo is not finished]
;B[qg]
C[so B comes in right away and it's difficult to kill B]
;W[pf];B[qk];W[rl];B[ok];W[mk]
C[W has decided to kill B now, but it's not a good idea because \
the game gets out of control.]

;B[rk];W[ql];B[pg];W[qi]
C[W launches the killing attack immediately, without properly preparing.]

C[it gets difficult now.]

C[62 should be at P12 instead (see var); playing at 62 is trying \
for too much]

C[O8 might be a little better; not clear]

C[W82 is slack; proper play is at M11]
;B[nh]
C[Now even though it looks impossible for B to live, B is gaining \
a lot of liberties and it's getting difficult for W. I was confused \
at this point.]

(;W[lg]
C[N14 doesn't work; maybe M14 is best. B has too many liberties; \
giving me a headache]
;B[kk];W[km];B[mn];W[kl];B[jk];W[im];B[il]
C[We're in a liberty race and W is just trying to extend his liberties.]

(;W[le];B[ne];W[nf];B[mg]
(;W[nd]
C[connecting at M14 doesn't work (see var)]
;B[li]
C[Now W has 2 problems: not only does W's center group have to \
live, but W must also destroy B's territory on both the top and \
the bottom. B has a good advantage at this point. This is what \
happens when I try to rush and end the game early!]
;W[gp];B[gq];W[hp];B[hq];W[fo]
C[W is basically alive now]
;B[md];W[oe]
;B[ke];W[lf];B[mh]
C[Not only does B live, but he does in virtual sente, because W \
owes a move in the corner]
;W[oc]
C[painful for W. very hard game for w now.]

(;B[ip]
C[B is returning the favor and trying to kill W now, but maybe \
it's not really necessary. Playing at O18 now might win the game \
for B.]

(;W[ep]
C[W can easily connect out at E6 but it's not enough, so I must \
play all out with the atari. Unfortunately I didn;t really gain \
all that much from the fight, as it turns out]
;B[en];W[dr];B[cr];W[fq];B[fr];W[ho]
C[only way to live]
;B[jn]
C[tesuji, but I have a counter-tesuji prepared]
;W[jo]
;B[kn]
C[I had been tired, but now I need every bit of concentration to \
get back in the game.]
;W[ln];B[lo];W[jm]
C[W lives and saves the tail]
;B[io];W[eo];B[eq]
C[now B goes all out to kill me]
;W[dp];B[ds]

C[the other atari doesn't work]

C[only way for W; otherwise sure death.]

;B[bk];W[al];B[bi];W[bh];B[ci];W[dh];B[cj];W[br]
C[so we reached a compromise; B lived and destroyed my territory \
and W's center group escaped.]

C[but B gained here]

C[only chance for w to win; if w doesn't get something here, he'll \
lose.]
;B[he];W[ge];B[gd];W[ie];B[hc]

C[b connects undeneath but w actually gained quite a bit with this \
exchange.]

C[P2 is much more solid]

C[This doesn't work, but it doesn't cost B much]
;W[oq];B[pr];W[nr];B[qq];W[rp];B[rq];W[os]

C[B gets this atari, so it's not too bad for him]

C[B actually gains from this.]

C[B still got this in sente, if I tenuki...]
