C[Up to 45, both sides have gained some territory. But since Black started the fight with a shimari, 

the result seems to favour White.]

;W[hq]

;B[jq]

;W[mm]

C[White's invasion at 46 first before pressing at 48 was the right order.

Since Black has played 47, White 48 is not ajikeshi.]

C[Up to 50, White has played the opening successfully.]

C[Black 59 is a bit hasty. It should be at 'a' to strengthen the corner.]

LB[pd:a];W[qe]

;W[qb]

C[White 60 and 62 are good moves. It is difficult for Black to find good replies. If Black

plays 'a', White will play 'b' to 'f' later. Black's corner gets very small and has bad aji.



If Black plays 'c' directly, a White play at 'f' later also makes the Black corner very uncomfortable.]

C[Black chose to fight the ko, but it seems that will not have a good result, because White has more ko threats.]

C[If Black 93 plays 'a' as the ko threat, White will answer at 'b'. White still has many ko threats for playing 'c'.]

C[After 110, White is ahead.]

C[Black 111 starts to attack the two White stones. That is the only way for Black to retrieve the situation.]

C[White 130 is the winning move. If Black plays 'a', White will play 'b' and 'd', and the

black group will be killed.



Black, with 119 etc., chose the wrong way to separate White. It makes him lose quickly.]

LB[eo:a][go:b][ep:c][gq:d]

;B[hp]

C[This is Black's only choice.]

;W[go]

C[After Black's five stones are killed, he lacks territory already, and there is bad aji

inside what there is of Black territory. White could play 'a' to 'g'. If Black 'b' cuts at 'c',

White can play 'g', then 'b'.]
