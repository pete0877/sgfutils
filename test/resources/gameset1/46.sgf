C[White at 'a' is joseki, but because of the position of Black's marked stone, building a

thick wall on the left side does not have good prospects.]

LB[gi:a]TR[cn]

;W[hf]

C[26 is the correct choice.]

;B[gi]

;W[cc]

;B[dd]

;W[cd]

C[If Black cuts at 'a', White would play 'b' to 'h'. Black's groups on the top and left 

side are all in danger.]

LB[jg:a][jf:b][ie:c][hi:d][kf:e][kg:f][id:g][ke:h]

C[If 49 is at 'a', White can come out with 'b', Black 'c', White  'd'. 



In this sequence, if Black 'c' is at 'e' instead, White would capture at 'c', Black 

'f', White 'g', pushing into Black's territory and achieving more liberties. since there are 

weaknesses at 'h' and 'd' between Black's enclosing stones, Black cannot kill White's group.]

;W[jf]

C[51 is the follow-up to 49.]

;W[id]

C[Up to 67, White has lived in sente. The result is good for White. Probably Black 43, 

49 and 51 were too strong.]

C['a' is the correct point to  attack Black.]

LB[ik:a];B[ij]

C[Fighting back at 83 is the only choice. Connecting at 'a' would be unbearable.]

LB[hi:a];W[ik]

;B[hk]

;W[il]

;B[gk]

C[White has helped Black gain eye shape in the centre, which is not good.]

;W[oq]

;B[np]

;W[pn]

;B[kp]

;W[hq]

;B[qq]

C[93 at 'a' is normal, but White would play 'b' to 'd' immediately. Black is 

obviously behind on territory, so he has to play aggressively to invade the corner.]

LB[jq:a][nr:b][mr:c][or:d];W[or]

C[White 94, separating Black, is the only choice.]

;B[ro]

;W[qm]

LB[qo:a][rn:b][rp:c][pm:d][on:e]

C[96 is questionable. This move gives Black the chance of living in sente in the 

corner. 96 would be better playing 'a' to 'e', compared with the game.]

;B[qp]

;W[po]

;B[nn]

C[Black lived in the corner in sente then got to play 99. The game is getting close.]

;W[ol]

;B[pr]

LB[rs:a][rm:b][rl:c][rn:d]

TR[ol]

C[With the marked white stone, Black 'b' to 'd' become gote. Black has to play 101 to 

prevent White playing 'a' to kill the corner.]

;B[dr]

C[Black 117 is big. But as the centre black group is without two 

eyes, exchanging 'a' for 'b' before 117 to make eye shape is necessary.



If White tenukis to play 117 when Black plays 'a', Black could play 'c', White 'd', 

Black 'e' then connect at 'b' to reduce White's territory.]

LB[ek:a][bl:b][cj:c][dj:d][ck:e][dk:f];W[kj]

C[118 is severe.]

;B[ek]

LB[dj:a][cj:b][ei:c][dh:d][ej:e][ci:f][fl:g]

C[Black 119 at 'a' to make eye shape 

would be more efficient. If White answers at 'b', Black 'c', White 'd', Black 119 would be better.



If White answers at 119 when Black plays 'a', then after Black 'e', White 'f', Black 'g', it 

would be difficult to kill Black.]

;W[ej]

C[Good move. Black's group is in danger.]

C[If Black had played  'a' , White 'b', Black 'c', White 

'd', he could have made more complications with 151. This may have been Black's last chance.



In this sequence, if White 'd' is at 'e', Black 'f', White 'g', Black 'h', White 'd', Black'j',

and White would be dead.]
