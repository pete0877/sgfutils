C[White sagari at - A - is the  normal reply.

;B[fb]

C[39 is a tesuji, the follow-up technique to Black 37 {marked}.

(;W[da]

C[White would have done better to play 'a' directly, then the >> variation result would be better than the 

game.

];B[ca];W[ac];B[gc]

C[Black 45 is a good move. Probably White overlooked it.

C[The sequence to 67 was a one-way street. The result  

favours Black. White did not achieve much 

territory in the corner, but left two weak groups on the outside.

];W[kc]

C[The white eight-stone group is very weak, but if White adds a move to strengthen it, Black 

would play - A -. In that case, White will have two unsettled groups. So, White chose to play 68 to get one group settled first.

]LB[lc:a]

;B[hj]

C[69 attacks White severely.

];W[gj]

;B[hk]

C[Black 71 is a bit passive. It is better at - A - Then if White

- B -, Black - C -, and White will find it difficult to come out.

]LB[ii:c][hi:b][gk:a]

;W[ej];B[dk];W[fl]

C[It seems that Black lets White come out too easily.

];B[hi]

C[Black 75 is a passive move again. It would be better at - A - directly. White cannot separate Black since he is still weak.

C[Black 109 is well timed. 

];W[bp]

C[Black - A - will be sente. If White ignores it, Black 

- B - would kill the corner. Without the exchange of 109 for

110, capturing at - A - would not necessarily be sente.

]LB[dr:b][hq:a]



;B[cj];W[kn]

C[After 112, because of Black's two passive moves, the game has

become close.

C[White could not fight the ko because he does not have enough

ko threats. Black could play  a ko threat at - A -, and then

has many threats afterwards.

]LB[nb:a]

;W[nk]

;B[pg];W[ok];B[qj];W[ob]

C[White 164 is to prevent a Black play at - A -.

]LB[nb:a]

;B[gb]

C[From the marked cut to Black's connection at 165, both Black

and White played very strongly.

;B[hh];W[mk];B[mn];W[nn];B[nm];W[fi]

C[After this the game is still close.

];B[pr];W[qm]

C[White 178 is the losing move. He should have 

exchanged  'a' to 'b'  first, and then played 178.

]LB[mq:B][np:A]

;B[qr];W[ql]

;B[oo]

C[White overlooked this. His four stones have been killed. White

has lost the game.

];W[op];B[np];W[rq];B[pb];W[pa];B[qa];W[oa];B[qb];W[rj]

;B[qi];W[qk];B[ja];W[lb];B[ne]
