C[With the sequence between the marked stones, Black had intended to attack white severely.



From the result, it seems that black  lost too much on  territory.

but there is a ko at - A -, so the question of whether the result

favours white will be decided by how much benefit black can get

from the ko.

C[Black fights back with an all-or-nothing move.

];W[of]

;B[nd];W[rd];B[pg]

C[White finds it difficult to answer when Black plays this probe.

If he connects at - A -, Black will play - B -  and white will not have enough eye space.

C[For Black 67 it may be better to play >> 'a', a variation in which he fights two kos at the same time.

C[White 84 invades Black's moyo. This will be the decisive battle.

];B[hd]

;W[ic];B[id];W[jc]

C[White 86, triangled, and this 88 are very big. If he had let Black block at 86 in sente, White would have lacked territory.



That was also part of the strategy of the moyo invasion at 84 - get the territory on the side first and see how much benefit

Black can get from attacking.

C[Black has to kill something to win the game.

C[Black 95 may be better at - A -.

;W[hj];B[fk]

C[Black 95, marked, and 97 seem too greedy. Since Black is not very thick, it's unlikely that he can he kill the whole white

group.

;W[jk];B[il];W[jl];B[im];W[ll];B[km];W[lh]

C[Up to 104, White has made a good shape. It will be easy for him to make two eyes.

the game.

C[As the two kos are comparatively smaller for Black, White has to give up one of them. If White now connects at - A - after

15, capturing the ko, Black will play - B - to separate the white stone in sente.
