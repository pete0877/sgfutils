C[Black 11 {marked} and 13 are an innovation by Gu Li, emphasising speed in the opening.]

C[White 16 {marked} and 18, playing lightly inside Black's moyo, are the right choice.]

C[Black 23 is a bit of wishful thinking. It is better at - A -.]

;W[of]

C[White 24 is somewhat passive. He could fight back at - A -. The ladder favours White.]

C[The white sagari {move 40, marked} then the jump to 42 do not seem right. If White intends to play 42, then 40 would 

be better at - A -. After 40, White does better to play - B - first as a probe before jumping to 42. White's shape 

would be thicker with - B -. Because White's shape has weaknesses, when Black blocks at - C - later in the game, White 

has no good move to attack the two black stones.]

C[White 74 at - A - is normal, but White has noticed that he is behind in territory, so he chooses to invade.]

C[After 115, White's group is alive and he has reduced Black's territory on the upper side, 

but his big group on the lower side has been getting weak. He has to pay for this later. So, Black is still ahead.]

C[Black 157 is better at - A -. Black spent a few moves to build up the centre, but he didn't get much, as we will see by the result.]

C[From the result, we can see that Black has spent the three marked stones to secure only about 8 points.]

C[After 274, Black has 8 more points on the board than White. It might seem he has won the game, but there are a ko and 12 neutral points {dame} left on the board. White has more ko threats, which is to his advantage.



According to Chinese rules, the dame have to be filled and counted, so White can use this advantage to answer Black in filling the last dame while also fighting, and then winning, the ko since he has more ko threats, Black will lose by 1/4 zi if play goes this way. Perhaps Gu Li felt it was more painful to lose this way, and so chose to lose on time.]
