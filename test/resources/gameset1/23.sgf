C[Black's exchange of 5 for 6 then the kakari at 7 is an interesting idea.]

C[If Black were to kakari at 5 now, this being the marked black stone, White would definitely respond at 25. If Black plays 25 without the marked exchange of 5 for 6, White would play the pincer attack at 'a'.]

C[Black got to play 27 so can be satisfied.]

;W[co]LB[fi:a]C[White 28 is better coming out with 'a'.

Although the result will not necessarily be good for White, it will be more complicated.]

;B[dn]

;W[eq]

;B[ei]

C[White chose a simple way to play, but it seems that the game is easier for Black.]

;W[qk]

C[Since Black is thick, 34 seems unreasonable. 'a' is normal.]

LB[qh:a];B[qi]

C[Black's invasion is severe.]

C[Black 37 and 39 aim to emphasise the control of right side.]

C[Up to 44, White achieved some territory, but his stones are all played on the upper side where 

there is no good prospect for either side to build a big territory.]

;B[lf]

C[45 is a good point. Black is ahead.]

C[Black 69, 71 and 73 are good invasion moves. White can play only to keep his stones connected.

He cannot fight back to protect his territory.]
