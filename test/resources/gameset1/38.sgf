C[White 34, and his next two moves, giving up the white stone on the fourth line, may be too generous. 

It gives Black a big territory on the lower side. Simply connecting at - A - is a better choice for White 34.]

C[Black 45 comes out here to eliminate the bad aji inside his own territory and also to make the white centre group less thick.]

C[It nows seems as if White's attempt to stir up trouble was an overplay. After 74 he hasn't gained much. The two black stones marked still have chances to escape.]

LB[rl:1][rm:2][sm:3][sn:4][sk:5]C[There is a ko if Black plays 1 to 5. 



So, by fighting, White managed to save his seven stones. However, he made Black's centre group stronger in 

the meantime. The white centre group is now in danger.]

C[If White 108 is at - A -, the fight might be more complicated than in the game.]
