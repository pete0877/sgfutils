C[The sequence to 16 was a popular joseki at that time.]

;W[ce]

;B[bf]

LB[df:a]C[18 emphasises territory. But from the viewpoint of 

morden go theory, most players would choose to 

play 'a' to strengthen the group and also help the 

upper Black stone at a distance.]

;W[df]

;B[dg]

;W[eg]

;B[be]

LB[bd:a][cc:b][cd:c][ef:d][de:e][dh:f]C[22 is good timing. If White blocks at 'a', Black would play 'b' to 'f'.]

C[Black and White have made an equal exchange here.]

C[This move often appears in the games of that period.]

C[White has played in a very efficient way. He has made 

some eye shape and now it seems that Black's shape is unsettled.]

;B[pc]

C[Black 42 may be better connecting at 'a'. In the game, 

Black gives White the possibility of making an eye in the corner with 'b'.]

LB[rc:a]C[Perhaps White 47 at 'a' is better. The corner move affects

the eye shapes for both Black and White.]

;B[rq]

;W[sp]

;B[ql]

LB[op:a][oo:b]C[Black 50 is aiming at playing 'a'. If he plays 'a' 

directly, White may fight back at 'b'.]

C[Good timing.]

;W[rl]

LB[si:a][se:b][ri:c]C[This is the only move. If White captures the Black 

stones with 'a', Black would play 'b' to 59, and White is not yet alive.]

;B[se]

TR[qc][pc]C[Black captured the four White stones and made the 

exchange of the marked stones bad for White. The result is therefore good for Black.]

;W[ok]

;B[pj]

;W[nk]

C[Good move. This is the only way to attack the Black group.]

;B[rm]

C[Black maybe should play 'a' to 'k' and then play 

68. White cannot make life with one move in this way.]

C[Up to here there are no options for either side.]

;B[si]

LB[ki:a]C[May be too early. It would be better to play 'a' to see how White reacts and then 

decide whether to play 88 to kill White.]

LB[nb:a]C[It seems Black is doing well up to here, but White 'a' 

is sente for White to connect on the second line.]

;W[km]

LB[jb:a][lg:b][mb:c]C[Black cannot separate White with 'c' if White 

plays 'a', because White can cut at 'b'. White 103 was played safely.]

;B[kn]

LB[ln:a][jb:b][qq:c]C[Black maybe should play 'a'. After White 'b', 

Black can live in the corner with 'c'.]

corner, but still cannot attack White severely after 

White 115. The result is not good for Black.]
