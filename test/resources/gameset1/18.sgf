C[Black 41 is aiming to extend the moyo on the lower side and to help the weak group on the 

left side at same time. But maybe the exchange 'a' to b' or 'd', then 'c' is more practical.]

LB[cm:a][cg:c][dn:b][bn:d]

;W[bk]

C[42 is the follow up to 40. If Black blocks at a, White would play 'b' to 'h'

to sacrifice the two stones. This result is not good for Black.]

C[After 49, Black has to come out without an eye. This result is also bad.]

C[Black 51 is probably better at 'a' to extend his moyo, or else he will fall behind on territory.]

C[White 68 to 80 seemed to be making trouble for himself. After 81, White has gained nothing but 

a weak group. The game has now turned in Black's favour.]

C[106 and 108 are good moves.]

;B[ph]

C[Judging by this result, Black 109 maybe should have chosen to play 'a', 'b', 109, 'c', 'd'.

C[Up to 130, Black has captured the four white stones, but hasn't achieved more 

territory because he lost too much on the side. The important thing is that White has discarded

his burden.]

;B[cr]

C[131 is gote. Probably 'a' is bigger.]

C[It seems that if Black intended to build up the centre, he should not have exchanged

'a' to 'd' to give White the possibility of coming out. 



It may be better to exchange 'e' for 'f' before Black 141. It will be more difficult for White 

to come out from the upper left. If White answers at 'g', 141 will be less big but then Black could atari at 'f' directly.]
