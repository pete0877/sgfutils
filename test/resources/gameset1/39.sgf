C[Black 19 {triangled} and 21 have not often appeared in professional games. Since there are white stones on the 

upper side and there is no black stone on the right side, maybe choosing the normal keima at - A - was better for 19.]

C[Of the two good points 35 and - A -, Black could only get one. Black cannot feel content with this as he has chosen to 

make a moyo.]

C[The key point to expand the moyos.]

;B[mg]

;B[pq]

C[Since Black has been developing a moyo, maybe it's better to play at - A - to follow the same idea.]

LB[np:A];W[pk]

C[Good point to reduce the black moyo.]

;B[pj]

C[Strong move.]

C[The aim of White 44 {marked} was to prevent a Black cut at - A -. If Black does play - A -, White can now play - B -.]

C[Black didn't play efficiently  on the right side. White is ahead now. Black has to build territory in the centre to keep the balance of territory.]

C[Black 63 {marked} to 85, separating White, looks impatient. After White's last move, it is difficult to attack the white centre group. So Black 63 perhaps should have been at - A - to reduce the white territory. The road to victory for White would then still be long.]

LB[fk:A][el:B]

C[White 86 at - A - is enough. In the game, White 86 gives black a chance to fight back at - B -.]

C[In the sequence up to 149, Black gains more points of territory, but White is getting stronger in the centre, and the game is getting less variable.]

;W[hf]

C[White is starting to attack the weak black stones. Since White is ahead on territory and also has the initiative, it's already very  difficult for Black to win the game.]
