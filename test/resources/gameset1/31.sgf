C[When White leaves the joseki unfinished then plays 14, the theory

is to play in a flexible way and to avoid make fixed shapes too

quickly.

C[Black 19 uses the marked stones to build influence.

C[Black 21 is passive. A play at < A > seems to attack White more

effectively.

C[Black turns to invade the corner. Variation >> 'a' does not do

much for him.

;W[cm];B[dm];W[dl];B[lp]

C[Black 45 starts complicated fighting. Since Black 

has given up the corner to make his group more thicker than before,

he must start some fighting to get territory  back from elsewhere.

C[Black 115 is going to use the ko threats on the lower side to

fight the ko .

];W[gc];B[jo];W[fc];B[ip]

C[There is a ko on the lower side, but White has built a big moyo

on the upper side. How much profit White can get from the ko

has become the issue  which decides the result of the game.

];W[gp];B[fp]

;W[jp];B[es];W[ds];B[fs];W[jj];B[ip];W[cg]

C[Because White does not have enough ko threats, 

maybe this is not the right time to fight the ko. It may be better

to play < A > to extend his moyo.

C[Black 167 is too greedy.  If he plays variation >> 'a', he will

live easily.

C[232 is better at < A > which is bigger. If White plays < A >,

the game is still close.

C[Black has no ko threats and so cannot fight the ko. He also has

to capture at the end. So the result favours White.
