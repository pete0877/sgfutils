C[up to here is joseki]

C[also possible for W to connect under at B8]

C[a little questionable; should have exchanged G4 for G3 first \
to make it harder for B to connect]
;B[fn];W[ef];B[de];W[hk];B[ii]
C[kind of aggressive; B thinks my thickness is a weak group.]

(;W[hi]
C[not sure if this is best; hard to decide. maybe J13 is easier]
;B[ij];W[gk];B[fl]
(;W[hm]
C[it's a little difficult here. maybe J9 is better. not sure]

C[very aggressive]

(;W[kl]
C[W is prepared to fight too, but 58 is questionable. should probably \
atari at L9 first and then connect. I was still on San Diego \
time so maybe I wasn't really awake yet :)]
;B[kk]
(;W[lk]
C[also questionable. maybe just extending at M8 is better (see \
var)]
;B[ki];W[in];B[jm];W[ll]
C[w still owes a move here]
;B[jn];W[ig];B[lj];W[jh]
;B[ji];W[nk]
C[the game seems about even right now, but W has nice potential \
on the right side and B's group is a target. But W did not play \
too well here...]
;B[kh]
(;W[kf]
C[this is too aggressive and complicates the game unnecessarily. \
just jumping to J15 is good enough. I thought B's center group \
was weak but B did not agree and resisted strongly.]
;B[jf]
C[now things get complicated; w feels like the game is slipping \
out of control.]
;W[kg];B[jg];W[ih];B[je]
C[now it's difficult for both]
;W[he]
C[both players have a lot to manage]
;B[nj]
C[not sure what to do at this point. too many things going on.]
;W[mf]
;B[hf]
C[B gains here]
;W[gf];B[hd];W[ge];B[ie];W[gd];B[gc];W[if];B[ic]
C[B connects back and picks up some territory]
;W[ok]
;B[oj];W[pj];B[pi];W[qi];B[ph];W[qj]
(;B[od]
C[this is tremendously aggressive! I think Q15 is good enough for \
B]
;W[nh]
(;B[og]
C[so aggressive; I expected either O11 or P12]
;W[ng];B[oi]
C[now there's no turning back for anyone]
;W[oe]
C[tesuji]

C[B tries his hardest]

C[best place to play]

C[trying to keep up pressure on both B groups]
;B[qf];W[re];B[rb]
;W[rc];B[qa];W[qc];B[rf]
C[now it's a liberty race]
;W[ra];B[sa];W[pa];B[mb];W[lb]
C[no choice]
;B[mc]
;W[ld]
C[also no choice]
;B[oa];W[sc]
C[all these moves are driven]
;B[ra];W[sf]
C[winning tesuji. If B pulls back at S13...(see var)]

(;B[se]
(;W[sd];B[la];W[rg]
C[this kills B unconditionally]
;B[me];W[le];B[lg];W[lf];B[kb];W[mj]
;B[mi];W[mk]
C[B can save half his group by playing at N12. But it's gote and \
he loses half the group.]

(;B[ni];W[mh];B[pg];W[lh];B[li];W[qh];B[kc];W[kj]
C[B is one liberty behind, so he loses the capturing race.

B resigns.]
