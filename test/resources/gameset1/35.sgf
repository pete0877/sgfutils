C[If White 12 is at 'a', Black will play 'b', and it will become a moyo game for both sides.]

C[Since there is no white stone at 'a', the attack of 16 is not severe. Playing at 'b' seems  better.]

C[If White 20 is atari at 'a', Black would connect at 20, White 'b', Black 'c'. White would lose too much on territory if he played this way.]

C[White 38 and 40 are unreasonable. 38 can only defend at 'a'.]

C[46 cannot cut at 'a', because  Black can play 'b', after which he can play 46 or 'c'. ]

LB[de:a][eg:b][fj:c];B[bp]

C[47 keima directly wants to keep the possibility of atari at 'a'. but it might be losing a good 

opportunity to take the lead from here. If 47 blocks at 'c' first, White has 

to capture at 'b', then keima at 47, White 'd' to 'i', and the three 

marked white stones will be captured.]

C[This is ajikeshi. Black can throw in at 'a' directly. If White 

captures with 'b', Black 79, White 'a', Black 'c' can capture the marked stones with ko. 



If White answers at 79 when Black throws in at 'a', Black can play 'd', then if White 'e', 

Black 'f', and White would lose even more.]

C[If White adds a move in the centre to make sure the centre group is alive, Black would play an 

extension on the upper side. White could not compete on territory with Black this way.]

C[112 is very strong. But the exchange of 'a' for 'b' before it would be better - this little 

mistake caused White's failure.]

C[White 118 still should be the exchange of 'a' and 'b'.]
