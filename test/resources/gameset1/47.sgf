C[Qiu Jun plays two-space pincers in tournaments often.]

C[After 12, the result is equal for both sides. This position has appeared in other games Qiu Jun played in recent tournaments.]

;B[fq]

;W[dn]

;B[jp]

;W[fc]

C[16 is a strong move in this position.]

;B[gc]

LB[ec:a]C[17 is the only choice. Playing 'a' is impossible. ]

LB[gd:a][hb:b][db:c][fb:d][ic:e][jc:f][ib:g][jb:h][id:i][ia:j]

C[21 could also play 'a' to 'j'. White cannot kill the corner unconditionally. This variation is very complicated, with no final conclusion.]

;W[db]

;B[cb]

LB[hb:a]C[23 at 'a' is possible.]

;W[hb]

;B[da]

LB[ic:a][ib:b][jc:c][eb:d]C[25 is a tesuji. If he plays 'a' to 'c', White could make life at 'd' with better aji.]

;W[eb]

;B[ea]

;B[ic]

;W[ib]

;B[jc]

;W[jb]

;B[kc]

;B[lc]

;W[bd]

C[After 36 the Black corner is dead. The conclusion from the players was that the result is good for White, because White's territory is too big.]

;B[pl]

;W[qj]

;B[qh]

;W[oj]

;B[ql]

;W[nk]

;B[nm]

;W[lk]

;W[qq]

C[46 is good timing. Black has to kill to compete on territory.]

;B[pr]

;W[qo]

;B[pp]

;W[rn]

;B[rm]

;W[qr]

;B[rr]

C[Locally White is dead, but he has a forcing move at 'a', Black has got a thin shape, and there is a weakness at 'b'.]

LB[rk:a][om:b];W[hq]

C[After 54, it is difficult for Black to make a decision. If the corner exchange of 46 to 53 had not taken place, Black would definitely play 'a'. Since White did play 46 to 53,  there is bad aji in the lower right corner already, and so Black has no inclination to play 'a' now.]

LB[jq:a];B[jl]

C[Black chose  to tenuki.]

;W[jr]

C[White of course gets to play inside Black's territory.]

;B[kj]

;B[qp]

;W[ml]

C[White's big group is alive. White is ahead.]

;B[cq]

LB[ni:a]C[Black playing at 'a' to expand his territory would be better than the game.]

;W[dq]

;B[cr]

;W[eq]

;B[bn]

;W[lb]

C[After 84, White is obviously ahead on territory. In this game, Black lost without a chance.]
