C[Black separated White with the marked stones to start a fight.

But then he played an approach move in the upper left corner,

letting White play the one-space pincer at - A - and make an

extension at the same time. This doesn't seem to follow the idea

of the marked stones.

C[Black must invade the White territory at 

29. If this white group gets settled, the four 

black stones on the upper left corner will 

all become inefficient.

C[Black 45 is a mistake. It should be at - A - to 

shut the white group in. White has to play 

- B - to capture the four black stones, then Black  can attack

the weak white group. Black could gain the initiative by  playing

this way.



If Black plays - C - in the future, White has to 

kill the four black stones through a 

capturing race, so, the corner is not as big as 

it seems.

C[The game is easier for White after he gets 

the hane at 46.

];B[fd]

C[White 48 may be better at - A -. Shutting black in and making

the white group thick are more  important than saving the corner.



On the other hand, the corner is not 

easy to kill. If Black plays - B -, after White - C - to - E

- Black has got a very strange shape.

C[The black group has come out. The fighting 

becomes very complicated.

C[Black 91 should peep at - A - first.

]LB[km:A]

;W[kp];B[lq];W[ko];B[kn];W[ir];B[im]

C[If Black had exchanged - A - for - B - before, he could protect

the cut with 97 at - C - now. It is a very big difference.



the black group in the upper left corner is 

nearly dead. Black could only reduce the 

corner from outside. so, White is ahead in 

territory. If Black cannot gain enough 

territory from attacking the weak white 

group, he cannot compete territorially 

with White.

C[White 106 {marked} was not necessary. After this exchange, Black

'a' become sente. It gives Black the possibility  of making a

eye in gote in the centre.

C[Because of the cutting point, white settled 

his big group with out much difficulty. After 

134, the game is  easier for white.

C[Black 163 is the losing move. Playing - A  to 

strengthen himself and forcing White to play - B -,  and then

playing - C - , may be the only way to compete territorially.

C[White reduced the Black territory on the 

upper side and corner in sente, then got 

the big move 174. White is winning.
