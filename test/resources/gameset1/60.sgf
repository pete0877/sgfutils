KM[0.5];B[pd];W[dp];B[qo];W[dc];B[op]C[I like  this opening because either the opponent gives me large ter or he
lives small inside and I press from outside, get 2 walls along lines 5 and
p, and retain sente. what do you think ?
This is unusual, but not bad -- if you follow up well.];W[qi];B[pk]C[7  at R9 is better, so white can't slide under.]

;B[cn];W[cl]C[The exchange of 25-26 is much better for white  than black because W
gets a base for his group and starts to destabilize B at C15.  B should play
joseki at C3 or F4.]
(;B[dm];W[ci];B[fq]C[what do you think of this sequence as  reaction to the c8 pincer ?
B gets a little added strength with D7 to pressure the corner, but not
enough to do serious damage.   And B gives up a lot when W gets C11.];W

pressure W while strengthening B.  And then to play H6 so the B stones in
the corner don't get cut off and killed.];W[pc];B[od];W[ra]C[I think s19  redundent, w lives anyway.
You're right.];B[rj];W[qj];B[qk];W[oh]

top.  Otherwise the B stones at J6 can be cut off and attacked.];W[nm];B

could save id and make the cut, which is almost surely fatal for f15 group.
