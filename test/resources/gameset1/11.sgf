C[Shusai's comment: Should be at - A -.]

C[The usual invasion at - A  is more suited to this position, said Shusai]

LB[qc:A]

;B[qc];W[nc];B[nd];W[oc];B[od];W[mb];B[lc];W[qb]

C[This should be at - A -. Shusai expected this 61 to be a forcing move, with Black answering at - B , and then he would have played at - A -, but he was being greedy.]

C[Bad aji but inevitable, according to Go.]

;W[mh];B[nf];W[ma];B[cc];W[dc];B[bh]

C[Too early, in Shusai's opinion. The right move is at - A .]

C[Black would like to play - A-, said Go, but then White can cause complications.]

;W[hl]

C[Slack, said Shusai. It should be at - A -, which gives White reasonable prospects.]

;B[bq];W[br];B[bp];W[ar];B[bm];W[fi];B[gk];W[hn];B[ek];W[id]

C[Shusai remarked that the correct order was to exchange White - A - for Black - B - first.]

;B[jd];W[hc];B[bd];W[ce];B[hb];W[hd];B[je]

C[The wrong way - extension to - A - was better in Go's opinion.]

LB[gb:A]

;W[ib];B[jc];W[gb];B[be];W[bc];B[bf];W[cf];B[ag];W[ij];B[fm]

C[White now pays for not having made the - A - for - B - exchange, which prevents the cut, and Black moves into a clear territorial lead, according to Shusai.



Had the A-B exchange been played, Black would now play not this 122 but - C -, White - D -, Black - E -. It was good to be able to play 122, said Go.]
