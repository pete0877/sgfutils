C[The result of the fight in the upper left corner favours White.

Once White played 14 {marked}, there 

was almost no variability in  the sequence to 33. so Black 13

should have been the marked kosumi, as pointed out before.

C[Probably White felt he was ahead when he played 38 and 40. But

38 {marked} and 40 are too easy going. He lost a lot on territory.

C[Because the ladder favoured Black, White gave 

up the stone at - A -.  As White has thus given up a lot of territory

in the bottom right corner, he now has to build something in

the centre to compete territorially with Black. But with Black

1 to 3 being sente, it is quite difficult for White to manage

the centre.

C[Black 63 {marked} and 65 were unnecessary. Simply atari at -A -, forcing connection at - B -, then playing - C - is the effective way to reduce White's moyo.]
