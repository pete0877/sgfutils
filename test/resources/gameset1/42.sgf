not choose the joseki at >> 'a'.

C[For Black it is better to play >> 'a' so that he can tenuki to

play in the upper left corner.

C[Black tenukis to play on the up left corner. but in fact White's

cut at - A - is quite big. So, if Black is determined to get

sente here, 19 {marked} should have been the double hane into

the corner.

C[Black 37 is better at - A -.  This is a 

good point which looks after the whole 

board and builds influence of a kind

with the marked stones.

at - A -.

C[Black cannot capture these three white 

stones in a ladder.

C[White 66 is a good move in this position.

C[Black cannot allow White to escape by connecting  at 67 in sente.

C[After 74, White has killed Black in the corner and achieved about

25 points territory. White is ahead.

C[Black 75 is trying to stir up trouble.

C[Black 87 is the only way to live, with a ko.

;W[kb];B[kc];W[ib];B[ia];W[ha];B[cl];W[dl];B[hb]

C[It becomes an approach-move ko. As White can use the approach

moves as threats, the ko fight is difficult for Black.
