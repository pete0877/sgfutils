C[Black 7 is a new move. Exchanging - A - for - B - before 7 is normal. The aim of playing 7 directly is to keep the possibility

of - C - open.

and White.

C[Playing White 32 before Black expands his moyo with - A - to - C - is good timing.

C[If Black hanes at >> 'a', White reduces Black's territory in sente,  but this result is acceptable for both sides and may

be better than the game for Black.

C[After 46, White is ahead.  He has successfully reduced Black's territory and  built thickness outside  at the same time.

C[White 54 is a bit slow, perhaps paying too much attention to the territory in the bottom 

right corner. - C - is a big point at the moment, so it may be a better choice for 54 to exchange - A - for - B - then play

- C -.

C[Because of the loss of White 54, Black got the chance to play 61. After this move, White has lost both the possibility of expanding

his moyo and his leading position.

C[White 66 is a bit risky.]

(;B[kn]

C[If Black can play >> 'a', the fight will be complicated. If Black

were to live, White could not afford the loss of territory.

];W[ln];B[no];W[ok]

C[Black chose a conservative way to play with  67 and 69 {marked}.

After 70, White is ahead again. The try-on of 66 {also marked} has turned out to be a success.

C[White has made his group strong by attacking the black group

on the left side. He can therefore leave the centre to play a

big yose move. Because White is strong, Black cannot get much from attacking the centre white group.
