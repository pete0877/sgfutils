;B[qc];W[dp];B[qp]

C[Go Seigen's favourite opening then.]

;W[cd];B[oq]

C[He could also attack the upper left corner. 

];W[fc];B[ci]

C[This particular splitting attack was chosen because of White's

loose corner enclosure. Needless to say Black could also play

on the right side - this is a matter of feeling.]

;W[qj]

;B[ql];W[pf]

C[Good. This forces Black to answer here. Had he played 'a' instead,

Black could ignore it and play first on the lower edge. 

]LB[qg:a]

;B[nc]

C[Essential. Aims next at 'a' because White's formation there is thin. 

]LB[qh:a]

;W[jq]

(;B[cf]

C[A big area for both - White would like to play 'b'. However,

Black could consider playing `a' first. 

]LB[cg:b]

;W[oj]

C[Unusual, although Takagawa was very fond of deceptively simple

moves such as caps and one-space jumps.  



'a' instead had then recently been popular instead to defend

this type of position, but actually White has nothing to fear

from an invasion at 'b'. He simply lets Black take some profit

on the edge while taking outside thickness himself. 

]LB[qe:a][qh:b]



(;B[lq]

C[It is very difficult for Black to find the right point at present,

so he just occupies a big point and waits to see White's reaction.

He could have played `a'. 

];W[ck]

C[If `a' instead, Black plays `b' and stands better. 

]LB[cl:b][fp:a]



(;B[cn]

C[Difficult to say whether this is good or bad.  



White - Takagawa - expected 'a' or 'b'. Sakata also suggested 'a'.

But Go Seigen preferred to opt for a faster opening. 

];W[fp];B[cq];W[cp];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[er]

C[Joseki.]

;W[fo];B[dn];W[do];B[dk]

;W[dl];B[dj]

C[When Black invaded at the marked point, he had this entire sequence in

mind. As it happened, Takagawa accommodated him.  



Black is trying to make White overconcentrated while settling his own groups lightly. 

]TR[cq]

(;W[cl]

C[If `a' instead... 

];B[qh];W[oh];B[rf]

C[A logical continuation of Go Seigen's territory oriented strategy.]

;W[ol]

C[Steady and thick moves, though White still has a weak point at 'a'.  



White would also like to play 'b', aiming at 'c', but then Black

42 is big. 

]LB[re:c][lc:b][pj:a]

;B[kc]

C[Miai. Of course he could have played 'a' instead and White would

respond as in the game with 'b'. But then Black would have to

defend his weak extension with another move, and so end in gote.



Sakata suggested also 'c', accumulating territory slowly. 

]LB[qn:c][hc:a][ee:b]

;W[ee]

C[Quite natural. Combines defence with attack on the left. 

];B[bd]

C[A little premature. Sakata said 'a' was simpler and wiser. 

]LB[ef:a]

;W[be]

C[Aggressive.]

;B[ce]

(;W[bf]

C[Continues aggressively. 'a' instead would be a retreat from his previous aggressive move. 

];B[dd];W[cc];B[bc]

C[Strong resistance.]

;W[bb]

(;B[dc]

C[Black cannot cut at 'a'. 

];W[cb];B[bg];W[ac];B[de];W[ef];B[dg]

C[Natural flow. This corner sequence has been a beautiful example

of two players pursuing their opposing strategies to the limit.

Black has reduced White's corner but at the cost of making his

own group vulnerable.]

;W[nd];B[oc]

;W[md]

C[White is aiming at 'a'. Also, if Black gets to play 'b' White

can now play 'c' and vice versa. 

]LB[jd:c][db:b][re:a]

;B[mc];W[fk];B[fh]

C[White has expanded his territorial framework but weakened the marked stones.]

TR[fc][ee][ef]

;W[np];B[mr]

C[Black avoided the usual move at 'a' to stop White playing 'b'.

]LB[lp:b][nq:a]

;W[qn];B[kp]

(;W[op]

C[White must strengthen his stones now. If `a'... 

];B[pp];W[on];B[rj];W[rk];B[pi]

C[Normal tactics in this situation.]

;W[pj];B[ri];W[rl]

;B[jp]

C[A thick way of playing. A good point. 

];W[re];B[qf]

(;W[pd]

C[Tesuji. 'a' is inferior. 

];B[rd];W[ld]

(;B[lc]

C[Forced. Black would like to play 'a' but the result is bad for him.]

(;W[je]

C[A good combination. If `a'...]

;B[pg];W[og];B[pe]

C[Go later said this and his last move were very bad moves.]

;W[of];B[oe]

C[But this was the game-losing move. It is unnecessary, and now

that he has played it he cannot afford to let White capture his

two stones in sente.]

;W[od];B[qe];W[hh]

C[A well-timed cap. A very strong attack which also forms territory.



Black should have played in this area first instead of his mistakes

- mistakes because they were small moves - on the right.  



Now White can relax, although he is not yet ahead in territory.]

(;W[jd]

C[Not 'a'... 

];B[id];W[jc];B[hc];W[eb];B[ig];W[jg];B[km]

C[A good erasing move. If 'a' instead, White 'b' will be very good.

]LB[lm:a][jm:b]

;W[nq]

C[Starts a nice endgame squeeze.]

;B[nr];W[pq];B[or];W[rq];B[rp];W[qq];B[rr];W[ro];B[sq];W[kl]

C[A good play - takes account of White's strength in this area.]

(;B[ih]

C[If `a' instead... 

];W[ii];B[jl];W[jm]

C[A cross-cut is natural as White can fight strongly here - he

has control of much of the centre. 

];B[il];W[kk];B[kn]

C[Black has to worry about his marked stones because if White captures these it

will be very large. 

]TR[jl][il]

;W[in];B[hj]

C[Excellent.]

(;W[ij]

C[Best response. If `a' instead...

(;B[gl]

C[A little thin. he should have played 'a'.

];W[gj];B[gk];W[gi];B[ho]

C[A sacrifice to ensure escape. 

];W[hn];B[gn];W[io];B[ip]

;W[go];B[el];W[fl];B[em];W[fm];B[gm];W[hp];B[fn]

C[Black should first probe White's response with 'a'. 

]LB[bn:a]

;W[fj];B[en]

;W[bn];B[ek]

C[Black has connected his stones and has even rescued the marked stones, but his

group is still not yet secure. 

]TR[dn][cn]

;W[ei];B[fd]

C[Still looking for two eyes. 

];W[gd];B[ed];W[gc];B[fe]

C[Almost safe now. 

];W[bi]

C[Very good. A big endgame play while still pursuing the attack.

White was aiming at this point when he played the marked stone. It also denies

Black any opportunity to turn the tables.
