C[19 shows Black's fighting spirit. Normally Black would choose

to play - A -.

C[Black 21 is  preparation for playing - A -.

]LB[df:A]

C[White cannot play >> 'a' now as the marked stone played in preparation

means that the ladder favours Black.

]TR[ko]

;B[cf];W[ee];B[cd];W[cc];B[ch];W[jo]

C[Black reduced White's territory in the upper left corner, but

after 30, White has built 

territory and thickness on the lower side. It will be difficult

for Black to develop his moyo with White's thickness, so it is

hard to say Black's strategy of the marked stones was a success.

C[Black 31 is maybe too eager to start a  fight. 

];W[dh]

C[When White 32 comes out in sente, it seems that he will have the initiative in the fighting.

;B[ci];W[fg];B[eh];W[di];B[ei];W[dj];B[ej]

C[Black makes the  fight go very violent. It seems that it will

soon be clear who will win this game. There will be no  need to wait for the endgame.

];W[cj]

C[White 40 at - A - won't work - Black would shut him in with - B -. It is better to reduce Black's liberties with 40.

]LB[ek:b][dk:a]

;B[dk];W[bl]

C[Because White - A - to - C - is sente, he can play 42 directly.

]LB[bj:C][bg:B][cg:A]

;B[bm]

C[If Black 43 is at - A -, White will simply answer at - B -, then

moving out to the centre and linking up with to the corner are

miai.

C[Playing at >> 'a' was the only ko threat for Black. 

];W[ad]

C[Black is dead.

];B[ak];W[dd]

C[Black was under the illusion that he could kill White with 69 {marked} and - A -. but when White captures the five black stones, the big group has connected to the outside group.  The game has actually

finished now. Whatever Black plays later cannot change the result of the game.]
