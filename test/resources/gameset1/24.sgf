C[Because Black's upper right corner is occupied at the star point, White cannot get much benefit from a ladder breaker, and so he turns to attack Black's bottom right corner.]

LB[el:a]TR[en][fn][gm]C[White 46 prevents Black from making everything clear with only one move - atari at 'a'. After 46, the three marked black stones do not have many liberties. White can maybe take advantage of that later.]

C[162 is a good move. Black probably  overlooked it. After this, Black's marked stones have effectively been killed. Although Black could play 'a' to 'i' to make seki, White would capture the black stones on the outside in sente, so it is no better than being killed.]
