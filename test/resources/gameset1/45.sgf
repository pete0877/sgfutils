C[White 8, marked, will be an inefficient move if he plays 

'a' to 'f' which is joseki. White 20 is the correct theory to deal with this position.]

C[25 probably is not the best move. Black 'a' to 'e' to kill the corner would be better.]

LB[cl:a]

C[25 to 45 were nearly forced. Black has still been able to kill the corner this way, but 

the result is maybe not as good as if, as already mentioned, he had played the cut at 'a' at once. In the 

game he concedes too much on the left side and 

the two white stones on the bottom side are in a good position. They make Black's thick 

wall inefficient. White is ahead up to here.]

C[51 is tesuji.]

C[Connecting at 59 is the right choice. It's no good for Black to fight the ko as he has no big ko threats.]

C[Black 73 is questionable. As White tenuki-ed to 

play on the right side when Black played the marked stone, and Black got sente, 

jumping into White's territory at 'a' instead of 73 is more reasonable.]TR[he]

C[Up to 92, Black didn't achieve much from his attack.]

;B[ld]

LB[kf:a]

C[93 is not right. It can only be 'a' to separate White. Then he can look for an 

opportunity to attack both the white groups at the same time.]

C[White has got a chance to add a move in the centre to separate Black. It is 

obvious that Black's attack has ended up a failure.]

;B[ef]

C[Since White is very thick, 105 comes into White's territory too deeply. But Black has to 

take risks to compete on territory.]

LB[be:a][bb:b][eb:c][fc:d][bc:e]

C[Probably playing 'a' to 'e' is better. That way, 

Black reduces White's territory first then leaves the weak group for White 

to attack. Since Black is behind, he has to take risks.]

C[If 131 is 'a' to 'e' to live in the 

corner, White plays 'f' and the big group is difficult to save.]

C[If 137 is at 'a', White would play 137 then 'b' to 'g' to kill the big group.]

;W[ca]

C[After 138, the Black corner has been killed. It is difficult for Black to win the game now.]
