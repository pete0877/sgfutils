C[White 18 is a good move. Black is pressed into a low position.

C[After 24, White has got a thick wall and Black's 

position on the right side is low. White has played the opening

successfully. Black should have played at 24 on move 15, as pointed

out before -  the result would be better than the game.

];W[he];B[jg];W[je]

C[Although Black's last two moves were sente, he still cannot run out at 1. If he does so, White would 

play 2, and there will be two weak points, A and B.  This is why kosumi for Black 51 {marked} was better shape.

C[White played very well while attacking. He built up some points

in the centre and left Black's huge group with only two eyes.

After 154, Black has no chance of winning.
