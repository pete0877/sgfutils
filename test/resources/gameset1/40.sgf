C[Black 45 is a bit slow. Playing >> variation 'a'  is more efficient.

C[White's tiger's mouth 48, 50 and 52 is good play. It creates two cutting points in Black's position, - A - and - B -.

C[Black 53 is a bit slow. He could play  - A - to attack the white

group. In this way Black could strengthen himself while attacking.

C[Black 57 is again too slow. - A - is the key point for attacking White.

]LB[cr:A]

;W[cr]

C[White 58 is very big. Because of the slow moves of 53 and 57

{triangled}, White not only captured Black 13 {marked X}. but also

got the big move - blocking here at 58. Since there is a thick

white wall, it is unlikely that  Black will get much in the centre.

White is ahead after this move.

C[Perhaps White 66 at - A - is more efficient.

]LB[hj:A]

;B[bm];W[do]

C[The aim of White 68 is to  emphasise Black's weaknesses. White can play 1 to 7 later.

C[Black 85 should protect the cut on the upper side at - A -. But

in that case, white would play hane at 85, and Black is short of territory.

]LB[ee:A]

;W[ee];B[fe];W[ff];B[gf];W[fg];B[cd]

C[Black 91 is a tesuji for escaping. but he will still lose a lot of territory.

C[White did not give Black any chance in the endgame. 



The three slow moves - 45, 53, 57 {marked} - are the main reason Black lost this game.
