C[34 is a good point.]

;B[od]

C[If Black builds territory with 'a', it will be too small.]

;B[ng]

C[Black 41 is good move for separating the White weak group on the right side.]

;W[je]

C[Good move. If 'a' becomes sente, White could come out with 'c', because Black will not be able to cut at 'b'.]

LB[if:a][mf:b][of:c]

;B[if]

;W[mf]

;B[of]

;W[jd]

;B[lc]

;W[hq]

C[From here on we can see that White is very sensitive about territory. If he adds a move to strengthen the weak group on the upper side, Black will add a move to build up the lower side. White will be behind in territory if he plays that way.]

;B[gq]

;W[hp]

;B[kq]

;W[jp]

C[White 52 is slow. It would be  better to play at 'a' to strengthen the group on the upper side, judging by the result. If that group is thick, Black will find it difficult to attack the two White stones severely.]

LB[jg:a]

;B[ld]

C[The key point of the shape.]

;W[jf]

;W[li]

;B[le]

;W[lf]

C[White is attacked severely. It is very painful to have such awful shape.]

;B[ph]

;W[kp]

C[62 is slow again. It is better to cap at 'a'.]

C[After 67, Black is ahead.]

;W[rp]

;B[lq]

;W[hh]

;B[di]

C[Black 71 seems unnecessary. It gives White a chance to stir up trouble. Simply protecting against the cut at 'a' is better.]

LB[hg:a]

;B[ej]

;W[eh]

C[White 74 - marked - and 76 are very strong moves.]

C[After 95, although Black has made two groups alive, White has meanwhile got potential to build territory in the centre. The game has become complicated.]

C[Black 129 is small. It is better to play 'a' to 'e' to reduce the White territory and strengthen the Black group at same time.]

LB[qr:a][oo:e][rr:b][qp:c][rq:d]

;W[si]

;B[rg]

;W[jr]

C[Because Black is weak, White can torment him.]

;B[mp]

C[133 is trying to make life in an efficient way. But he seems reluctant.]

;W[mr]

C[Good move.]

;B[no]

C[Black has to follow his idea.]

;W[gr]

;W[gp]

;B[fq]

;W[pr]

;B[or]

;W[qr]

C[White is going to kill the group. If Black plays 'a', White will play 'b', and Black still does not have enough eye space.]
