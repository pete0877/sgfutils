C[Up to 14 is just the same as the Game 2 of the final.]

;B[ip]

C[In the second game, Black 15 was at 'a'. 15 is meant to be an improvement. But it's hard to 

say 15 is better than 'a', since the big point of 'b' becomes less valuable.]

C[21, to separate White, is the only choice in this position, otherwise Black would lose the

chance to attack the two White stones.]

LB[qr:a][qp:b][km:c]C[27 may be better at 'a', then White 'b', Black 'c']

;W[pl]

;B[qr]

C[If Black 29 is at 'a', White will play 29, then Black 'b' to 'f' is normal. But White 'g' would build a potentially huge territory. This 

result is good for White, so Black played hane.]

LB[km:a][ol:b][ok:c][nk:d][oj:e][or:f][qf:g];W[km]

TR[om][pl]LB[qp:A]C[If White 30 answers at 'a', it means being forced. 

Jumping out is the good move here. Now we can see why the marked exchange is good 

for White - because it helped to strengthen him.]

C[In their second game, Black played 'a' and built a thick wall. In this position, the thick 

wall towards the centre would be inefficient, so Black varies to play 41.]

C[The local position up to 48 was once played by Yu Bin 9d in a tournament. Most top 

professionals' opinion was that the result good is for White. In this the sequence, 

43 at 45 directly would be better. If White ataris at 48 first, he would have no chance to play the exchange of 46 and 47.]

LB[im:a][kk:b]C[58 is a good move. White could play 'a' to come out after 58, so Black 

has to add a move here to prevent 'a'. Eventually 57 becomes a slow move. 57 at 'b' may be better.]

;B[jn]

;B[lo]

LB[lh:a]C[Black 61 and 63, capturing two White stones, are small. Playing 'a' to expand the 

territory on the top side is bigger.]

;W[ob]

C[64 is a big move. Black is behind in territory.]

C[Since White 'b' is sente, Black cannot kill the corner with good aji. White 78 

makes life but is not very urgent. Playing 'a' to reduce the territory would be a stronger move.]

LB[lh:a][sd:b];B[li]

;W[mo]

;B[lp]

;W[mp]

;B[lq]

C[If Black 83 ataris at 'a', White would play 'b' to fight the ko.  White has many ko threats 

at the top.]

LB[nj:a]C[Black 93 at 'a' is more urgent. 'a' would prevent White coming into Black's territory at the top.]

;B[qo]

C[Black cannot allow White to connect in sente, so he chose to fight back.]

;W[oq]

;B[jd]

;W[nr]

C[White has achieved a big territory.]

;B[br]

;W[cp]

C[Since Black is behind, invasion at 'a' would be better. This is Black's last chance. Perhaps 

Wang Xi misjudged the situation.]
