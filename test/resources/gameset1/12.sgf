C[Go: I think 4 is bigger than - A -.]

LB[jc:a]

;W[ch];B[dn];W[jc];B[mc];W[jq];B[qj];W[me];B[jd]

C[Go: To play at - A - means being forced, and to play at - B - gives White the right momentum to play - C -.]

LB[je:C][ld:B][lc:A]

;W[kc]

C[Shusai: - A - is bad because of the ladder after Black 13..]

LB[kd:a]

;B[kd];W[lc];B[ld];W[md];B[nc];W[id]

C[Shusai: - A - is another possibility.]

LB[ic:a]

;B[kf];W[hd]

C[Shusai: - A - is correct, to avoid giving Black his next two forcing moves.]

C[If >> 'a' instead...]

;B[mq]

C[Go: One step further at - A - was better.]

LB[lq:a]

;W[gq];B[ej]

C[Go: It was better to defend the corner at - A -. ]

LB[eq:a]

;W[qp];B[qo];W[po];B[op]

C[Go: There are various possibilities here but I was confident White could not live in the corner.]

C[Shusai: It was a regrettable slip not to have exchanged - A - for Black - B - before playing this.]

LB[rm:b][rk:a]

;B[pn]

C[This negates the previously mentioned forcing move at - A -.]

LB[rk:a]

;W[or];B[nr];W[nq];B[np]

C[Shusai: Cutting at - A - was also possible.]

C[Go: - A - is also a safe alternative, as White's corner group can be captured.]

LB[jr:a]

;W[lq];B[kr];W[dk]

C[Shusai: Aims at pushing through at - A -. But it did not work out as expected.

The oversight of not playing at - B - earlier was decisive.]

;B[ci];W[dh]

;B[eh];W[dm];B[ip];W[cn];B[co];W[en];B[do];W[bm];B[el]
