C[The purpose of the marked stones was to get sente to play this kakari 15. But it seems that Black has given up too much territory.]

C[Black 21 is a big move, but it is perhaps better to exchange 'a' for 'd' before 21, which 

restricts White's liberties and therefore makes White's shape relatively weaker.

If White answers Black 'a' with 'b', Black will play 'c', White 'd', Black 'e' to make the 

left side territory for certain.]

C[After 22, Black's formation on the left side is not an efficient structure.]

C[28 is good timing. If Black blocks at 'a', White 'b', White can live either in the corner or on the side.]

C[29 is a strong move.]

C[Black 33 is facing a choice. If he plays 'a' to try to kill the White group, White 'b', Black 

'c', White 'd'. White's group seems not easily killable.]

LB[ri:a][rj:b]C[White 38 is hasty. Exchanging 'a' for 'b' before 38 is necessary. With the exchange 

of 'a' and 'b', White would easily make good shape, which is important for settling the weak stones.]

;B[ri]

C[39 is calm.]

;W[og]

C[41 is a good move. It is strengthening the corner as well as attacking White's whole group.]

LB[lj:a]C[White 44 may be an overplay. Jumping out to 'a' is normal.]

C[47 is the key point to reduce White's eye shape. It is painful for White.]

ko to separate Black on the edge.]

C[Black cannot answer the ko threat of 102, or else he would lose the ko since he does not have 

enough ko threats.]

C[White 122 at 'a' would be better. If Black plays 'b', White plays 'c' to 'i'. It would 

be a simple way to consolidate his lead.]
