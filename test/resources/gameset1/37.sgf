LB[qp:A][po:B][nq:C]

C[Black 17 starts a fight early. Usually Black would play - A - to - C -. Perhaps Black did not 

want to give White such good shape.]

;W[rk]

LB[qq:A][qr:B][pp:C]

C[It is possible for White to fight back with - A - to - C - in this position. White 18 played with a very tolerant attitude.]

C[White 26's aim is that if Black plays at - A -, White links up to the other white group at - B -.]

LB[nq:A][mn:B];B[mo]

C[Black 27, separating the two white groups, is the only choice.]

LB[ld:A]TR[od]C[Black played a very complicated fight. Since there is a weak point at - A -, Black didn't get much more territory 

compared with simply atari on move 63, as marked. But the three black stones on the right side are dead already. The result favours White.]

C[White 92 is a good point. It emphasises Black's weakness at - A -.]

C[White's kosumi at - A - is sente, so White could make the exchange before 102. The exchange could prevent a Black sagari at - B -.]

C[If White blocks at - A -, Black will play - B - to make the group live,]

LB[bo:A][bm:B];B[bo]

;B[dh]

C[White had to give up much territory in the lower left corner, but still cannot attack the  four black stones severely because they have good shape and so too many choices: run out, make eye shape, or start a ko.  The game is now easier for Black.]

LB[jf:A]C[White 140 is gote. He should have cut at - A -. In that case the ko fight is still complicated.]

;B[jf]

C[After Black connects at 141, he gets strong in the centre. It's impossible for White to kill the black group on the left side. It is obvious now that Black is ahead on territory, so White resigned.]
